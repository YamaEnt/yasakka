Now imagine that those awful floodwaters never, ever recede. Instead, the water just keeps rising and rising until your entire country drowns.<\/h3>\n<p>For a number of island nations, that&#8217;s ultimately the significance of the recent reports about <a href=\"http:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/read\/10-feet-of-global-sea-level-rise-now-inevitable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the unstoppable melt of the massive ice sheets of Antarctica<\/a> and Greenland, along with hundreds of glaciers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already lost some island atolls. On others the rising sea is destroying homes, washing away coffins and skeletons from graves,\u201d Tony de Brum, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, told me. \u201cNow with every full moon the high tides brings salt water into our streets. We\u2019re moving further inland but can\u2019t move much further.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Marshall Islands are located in the northern Pacific Ocean, and are home to some 70,000 people spread out over 24 low-lying coral atolls. Low-lying, as in six feet above sea level on average. Not only do rising seas flood and erode shorelines, they also make groundwater too salty too drink and \u201cpoison\u201d the land with salt so crops and even coconuts trees can\u2019t grow.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month <a href=\"http:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/read\/10-feet-of-global-sea-level-rise-now-inevitable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motherboard reported<\/a> that the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet was underway, guaranteeing a minimum of three metres (10 feet) of sea level rise.

Way up in Greenland, the same thing is happening, according to a new study in the journal Nature Geoscience. And then there was the recent US National Climate Assessment that found Alaska\u2019s and Canada\u2019s glaciers are pumping huge volumes of water into the ocean.<\/p>\n<p>Add it all up and this means many small island nations like the Marshalls\u2014along with countries like the Maldives, Tuvalu, Micronesia, Kiribati, Palau and others\u2014will be swallowed by the sea.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_177\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-177\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall\"><a href=\"http:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/literatum\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/1401200280336425.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-177\" src=\"http:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/literatum\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/1401200280336425.png\" alt=\"Tony de Brum (left) at UN climate COP 19 in Warsaw with US chief negotiator Todd Stern.

Will we become wards of another state?\u201d asked de Brum.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe news from Antarctica should be sobering to anyone from a coastal region around the world,\u201d said Ambassador Marlene Moses of the Republic of Nauru, a small island in the South Pacific home to fewer than 10,000 people.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>\u201cWe will be moving villages for decades to come. It\u2019s almost beyond comprehension.\u201d<\/h3>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Moses is also chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), a coalition of 43 low-lying island and coastal nations who are fighting hard to get countries like the US, Canada, China, Japan, and Australia to slash their CO2 emissions and keep future global warming below 1.5 C\u02da. Anything higher, they believe, and most of these nations will drown.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can tell you personally it has been very upsetting to witness what seems like an indifference to the plight of small islands,\u201d Moses said.<\/p>\n<p>When told of the recent science out of Antarctica and Greenland, Claire Anterea, a community worker from the central Pacific island nation of Kiribati responded in despair, \u201cMy gosh this is not fair! If the world can\u2019t stop the glacier collapse who will save my people and my country?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a beautiful life here,\u201d she said, \u201ca simple and subsistence way of living. It is unexplainable to know that our beloved home will disappear.\u201d Kiribati consists of 30-odd pancake flat coral atolls straddling the equator.<\/p>\n<p>The government of Kiribati is hoping to buy thousands of acres on one of Fiji\u2019s islands to relocate its 115,000 residents. While relocation may mean survival, the literal disappearance of their islands risks the overwhelming loss of their culture and identity. When you live on tiny islands in the middle of the enormous Pacific Ocean, land has a very special meaning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWithout our land how can I explain to my children their roots? Where they come from in the first place?\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_179\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-179\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall\"><a href=\"http:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/literatum\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/140120041171591.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-179\" src=\"http:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/literatum\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/140120041171591-2000x1539.jpg\" alt=\"Marlene Moses at the Bangkok Climate Change Conference in August 2012.

One is already being re-located to higher ground. Adapt and retreat is Fiji\u2019s future, and that of its 850,000 people.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe will be moving villages for decades to come. It\u2019s almost beyond comprehension,\u201d said Alifereti Tawake, a Fijian with the Locally-Managed Marine Area Network.<\/p>\n<p>About 80 percent of all villages are on the coast, he said in an interview from the capital city of Suva. Tawake\u2019s home village of Daku on Kadavu, a small outer island is being flooded during high tides and the people will have to move one day.<\/p>\n<p>People have a very strong attachment to their home village. Everything in the village has important family, cultural and spiritual significance. It is the roots of people\u2019s identity, Tawake said.<\/p>\n<p>Villages that have been proudly self-sufficient for hundreds of years are suddenly helpless and now have to ask for help from outsiders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are saying \u2018even if we do everything right, we can\u2019t do anything to stop this,'&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>&#8220;By the time the rest of the world awakes to crisis we&#8217;ve drowned. We are like cockroaches trying to herd elephants.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The small island of Hatohobei and Helen Reef Atoll in Palau is already eroding away. \u201cSoon we will be forced to leave our homes,\u201d said Wayne Andrew from Palau, a country of around 22,000 people, who are spread across 250 islands in the Western Pacific.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo be very honest, I feel really scared,\u201d said Andrews, who heads a reef protection organization in Palau. Local people wonder what they\u2019ve done wrong and \u201cwhy they have to pay the ultimate price when other nations are benefiting from all this,\u201d he said, referring to wealthy nations\u2019 high CO2 emissions.<\/p>\n<p>Painful discussions are underway about relocation and moving traditional taro patches and gardens to higher places. There is a lot of work being undertaken to find ways to adapt to the impacts climate change, he said. But ultimately \u201cit is very difficult to know much of our country will vanish.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_180\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-180\" style=\"width: 1598px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall\"><a href=\"http:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/literatum\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Mal\u00e9_after_tsunami_cropped.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-180\" src=\"http:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/literatum\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Mal\u00e9_after_tsunami_cropped.jpg\" alt=\"Mal\u00e9, the capital of the Maldives, after the 2004 tsunami.

This is all about countries agreeing to make major reductions in their CO2 emissions that are heating up the planet. A climate-saving treaty is supposed be finalized at the end of 2015. To say negotiations are not going well is an understatement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no sense of urgency. It\u2019s frustrating,\u201d said Foreign Minister de Brum, who had just returned home to the Marshall Islands from an informal round of UN climate talks. Countries with the biggest CO2 emissions are more concerned about their economies than the survival of small island nations de Brun said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By the time the rest of the world awakes to crisis we&#8217;ve drowned,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are like cockroaches trying to herd elephants.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of cockroaches, the three-coral atoll nation of Tokelau became the first country in the world to become 100 percent powered by renewable energy last October.

We are fighting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGiving up on our home is not an option,\u201d said Tokelau\u2019s Mikaele Maiava, an activist with 350.org.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are warriors, and the land we live on is part of us.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Imagine the street you live on is knee-deep in floodwater, and it\u2019s ruining everything in sight, including your home.
