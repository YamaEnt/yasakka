<p class="has-drop-cap has-small-font-size">The fine-structure constant was introduced in <strong>1916</strong> to quantify the tiny gap between two lines in the spectrum of colors emitted by certain atoms. <strong>The closely spaced frequencies are seen here through a Fabry-Pérot interferometer.</strong></p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>As fundamental constants go, the speed of light,&nbsp;<em>c</em>, enjoys all the fame, yet&nbsp;<em>c</em>’s numerical value says nothing about nature; it differs depending on whether it’s measured in meters per second or miles per hour. The fine-structure constant, by contrast, has no dimensions or units. It’s a pure number that shapes the universe to an astonishing degree — “a magic number that comes to us with no understanding,” as Richard Feynman described it. Paul Dirac considered the origin of the number “the most fundamental unsolved problem of physics.”</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Numerically, the fine-structure constant, denoted by the Greek letter α (alpha), comes very close to the ratio 1/137. It commonly appears in formulas governing light and matter. “It’s like in architecture, there’s the golden ratio,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/physics/eric-cornell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Cornell</a>, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. “In the physics of low-energy matter — atoms, molecules, chemistry, biology — there’s always a ratio” of bigger things to smaller things, he said. “Those ratios tend to be powers of the fine-structure constant.”</p>



<p>The constant is everywhere because it characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic force affecting charged particles such as electrons and protons. “In our everyday world, everything is either gravity or electromagnetism. And that’s why alpha is so important,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/holger-muller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holger Müller</a>, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. Because 1/137 is small, electromagnetism is weak; as a consequence, charged particles form airy atoms whose electrons orbit at a distance and easily hop away, enabling chemical bonds. On the other hand, the constant is also just big enough: Physicists have argued that if it were something like 1/138, stars would not be able to create carbon, and life as we know it wouldn’t exist.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"/>



<h2 class="line-height-1dot5" style="font-size:24px"><strong>Physicists have more or less given up on a century-old obsession over where alpha’s particular value comes from; they now acknowledge that the fundamental constants could be random, decided in cosmic dice rolls during the universe’s birth. But a new goal has taken over.</strong></h2>

<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Physicists want to measure the fine-structure constant as precisely as possible. Because it’s so ubiquitous, measuring it precisely allows them to test their theory of the interrelationships between elementary particles — the majestic set of equations known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-map-of-the-standard-model-of-particle-physics-20201022/">Standard Model of particle physics</a>. Any discrepancy between ultra-precise measurements of related quantities could point to novel particles or effects not accounted for by the standard equations. Cornell calls these kinds of precision measurements a third way of experimentally discovering the fundamental workings of the universe, along with particle colliders and telescopes.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>With a margin of error of just 81 parts per trillion, the new measurement is nearly three times more precise than the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/191" target="_blank">previous best measurement</a>&nbsp;in 2018 by Müller’s group at Berkeley, the main competition. (Guellati-Khélifa made the most precise measurement before Müller’s in 2011.) Müller said of his rival’s new measurement of alpha, “A factor of three is a big deal. Let’s not be shy about calling this a big accomplishment.”</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>Guellati-Khélifa</strong> has been improving her experiment for the past 22 years. She gauges the fine-structure constant by measuring how strongly rubidium atoms recoil when they absorb a photon. (Müller does the same with cesium atoms.) The recoil velocity reveals how heavy rubidium atoms are — the hardest factor to gauge in a simple formula for the fine-structure constant. “It’s always the least accurate measurement that’s the bottleneck, so any improvement in that leads to an improvement in the fine-structure constant,” Müller explained.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full full-width wild-element is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1325" src="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/greg-rakozy-53292-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-643" srcset="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/greg-rakozy-53292-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/greg-rakozy-53292-300x155.jpg 300w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/greg-rakozy-53292-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/greg-rakozy-53292-768x398.jpg 768w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/greg-rakozy-53292-1536x795.jpg 1536w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/greg-rakozy-53292-2048x1060.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption>Look this <strong><em>nice</em></strong> <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Image Caption</span></strong>!</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Paris experimenters begin by cooling the rubidium atoms almost to absolute zero, then dropping them in a vacuum chamber. As the cloud of atoms falls, the researchers use laser pulses to put the atoms in a quantum superposition of two states — kicked by a photon and not kicked. The two possible versions of each atom travel on separate trajectories until more laser pulses bring the halves of the superposition back together. The more an atom recoils when kicked by light, the more out of phase it is with the unkicked version of itself. The researchers measure this difference to reveal the atoms’ recoil velocity. “From the recoil velocity, we extract the mass of the atom, and the mass of the atom is directly involved in the determination of the fine-structure constant,” Guellati-Khélifa said.</p>

<p>In such precise experiments, every detail matters. Table 1 of the new paper is an “error budget” listing 16 sources of error and uncertainty that affect the final measurement. These include gravity and the Coriolis force created by Earth’s rotation — both painstakingly quantified and compensated for. Much of the error budget comes from foibles of the laser, which the researchers have spent years perfecting.</p>

<p>For Guellati-Khélifa, the hardest part is knowing when to stop and publish. She and her team stopped the week of February 17, 2020, just as the coronavirus was gaining a foothold in France. Asked whether deciding to publish is like an artist deciding that a painting is finished, Guellati-Khélifa said, “<strong>Exactly. Exactly. Exactly</strong>.”</p>



<p>Surprisingly, her new measurement differs from Müller’s 2018 result in the tenth digit, a bigger discrepancy than the margin of error of either measurement. This means — barring some fundamental difference between rubidium and cesium — that one or both of the measurements has an unaccounted-for error. The Paris group’s measurement is the more precise, so it takes precedence for now, but both groups will improve their setups and try again.</p>

<p>Though the two measurements differ, they closely match the value of alpha inferred from precise measurements of the electron’s&nbsp;<em>g</em>-factor, a constant related to its magnetic moment, or the torque that the electron experiences in a magnetic field. “You can connect the fine-structure constant to the&nbsp;<em>g</em>-factor with a hell of a lot of math,” said Cornell. “If there are any physical effects missing from the equations [of the Standard Model], we would be getting the answer wrong.”</p>



<p>Instead, the measurements match beautifully, largely ruling out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-boson-claim-faces-scrutiny-20160607/">some proposals for new particles</a>. The agreement between the best&nbsp;<em>g</em>-factor measurements and Müller’s 2018 measurement was hailed as the Standard Model’s greatest triumph. Guellati-Khélifa’s new result is an even better match. “It’s the most precise agreement between theory and experiment,” she said.</p>



<p>And yet she and Müller have both set about making further improvements. The Berkeley team has switched &#8230; </p>

<h3 class="line-height-1dot5 has-medium-font-size"><strong>For all of Bitcoin’s fabled transparency, a key piece of this bubblicious puzzle remains elusively opaque. Who the hell is Satoshi Nakamoto?</strong></h3>



<p>Like a frustrating episode of Lost, there’s one too many clues and few if any answers. Satoshi, of course, is the one who started it all, unleashing his concept of a cryptographic, self-regulating digital currency to the world in his now infamous whitepaper in 2008.</p>



<p class="border-radius-5 box-shadow-large has-white-color has-pale-pink-background-color has-text-color has-background has-medium-font-size">Three years later, he was gone.</p>



<p>Today, Bitcoin is a billion dollar idea being adopted across the globe, and yet little is known about its enigmatic creator. The result has been wild speculation. Ted Nelson, the American pioneer of information technology who coined the term “hypertext,” <a href="http://qz.com/86255/the-mysterious-creator-of-bitcoin-could-be-japanese-mathematician-shinichi-mochizuki-says-the-inventor-of-hypertext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week proposed</a> that Satoshi was a well-known, reclusive Japanese mathematician. <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Yorker</a></em> and <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1785445/bitcoin-crypto-currency-mystery-reopened" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fast Company</em></a> have conducted their own investigations. Various theories <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5951.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulate on the web</a>.</p>



<p>Given Satoshi’s paranoid preservation of his privacy, there are no conclusions, only educated guesses. But who doesn’t love a good conspiracy theory, especially when the topic is a disruptive technology that many believe has the potential to truly shakregistere things up?</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size">WHAT WE KNOW</h3>



<p>Satoshi appeared seemingly out of nowhere in 2008 when he <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a research paper</a> on the <a href="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptography Mailing List</a>, which laid the foundation for the Bitcoin protocol. He claimed to have been working on the idea for about two years, which, given the robustness of what was produced, implied an exhaustive amount of effort dedicated toward his work.</p>



<p class="text-shadow-1 border-radius-5 site-palette-yang-1-color site-palette-yin-1-background-color">In January of 2009, he started mining, creating what is known as the “<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genesis block</a>.” Bitcoin v0.1 was released six days later. By year-end, over 32,000 blocks had been added to this original block, producing a total of 1,624,250 bitcoins. Since all transactions are public on the blockchain, we know that only a quarter of those bitcoins have ever changed hands, leading some to speculate that Satoshi could be sitting on a stash of roughly one million bitcoins, worth ~$120 million at today’s exchange rate.</p>



<p>In the early days, Satoshi was active on the Bitcoin Forum and regularly responded to emails. Though Bitcoin is an open source project, most modifications to the source code were made by Satoshi himself in the first year, but his activity soon began to peter out.</p>



<p>His final programming contribution was made in mid-2010, after he had passed on the reins to Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin’s current lead developer. In April of 2011, when asked of his dwindling activity, Satoshi explained to one Bitcoin developer that he had “moved on to other things.” At some point, he stopped replying to emails altogether, including those of Andresen. The creator had disappeared.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone size-large is-style-default box-shadow-medium site-palette-yang-1-color border-radius-5 site-palette-yin-1-background-color"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/e43df6bd0d8e4d147b11f0b373e5c41d-1024x640.png" alt="" class="wp-image-606" srcset="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/e43df6bd0d8e4d147b11f0b373e5c41d-1024x640.png 1024w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/e43df6bd0d8e4d147b11f0b373e5c41d-300x188.png 300w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/e43df6bd0d8e4d147b11f0b373e5c41d-768x480.png 768w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/e43df6bd0d8e4d147b11f0b373e5c41d-1536x960.png 1536w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/e43df6bd0d8e4d147b11f0b373e5c41d-2048x1280.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>An internet representation of Satoshi Nakamoto</figcaption></figure>



<p>The name Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to be a pseudonym for a person, a group, or even a larger, possibly governmental organization. In Japanese, Satoshi means “clear-thinking” or “wise.” Naka can mean “inside” or “relationship” and moto is used to describe “the origin” or “the foundation.” Put it all together and you get “thinking clearly inside the foundation.” There’s scant evidence that Nakamoto existed outside the context of Bitcoin.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>According to his P2P foundation account details, Satoshi claimed to be a 37-year-old male living in Japan. His language of choice was English, but he would alternate between British and American spellings and colloquialisms, which could mean that he was trying to mask his nationality or that Satoshi is actually more than one person. He would post on the forums and respond to emails at random times with no discernible patterns that might indicate a primary time zone.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<p>Based on his limited body of work, we know that Satoshi is highly intelligent and economically competent. He’s a brilliant mathematician, well-versed in cryptography, and a capable programmer, though his code indicates that he most likely wasn’t a professional.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>While theoretically sound, his style belied his experience (or lack thereof), leading some, including Andresen, to believe that Satoshi is an academic. A prominent fear in the early days was that some exploitable flaw in the Bitcoin system would eventually surface, undermining the movement. Four years later, the protocol remains bulletproof, a testament to Satoshi’s genius, foresight, and thoroughness. It also suggests that, if he really is a single entity, Satoshi is a hell of a proofreader.</p>



<p>Though it appeared that Satoshi understood that the Bitcoin movement might attract its fair share of ideologues, such as anti-government libertarians, it’s unclear whether or not Satoshi was politically motivated himself. If at times he seemed eager to recruit such groups to the cause, his intent could be interpreted as pragmatic. Keenly aware of the potential social implications of his idea, he left the politicizing to others.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly,” he wrote. “I&#8217;m better with code than with words though.” We know, based on his writings, that he had qualms with the banking system and saw Bitcoin as a technological solution:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that&#8217;s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.</p><p>A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what. Its time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size">THE PRIME SUSPECTS</h3>



<p>Analysis of Satoshi’s coding and writing style have been inconclusive. But with the facts available, a few prominent suspects have emerged, some more widely accepted than others.</p>



<p><strong>Gavin Andresen</strong>: As the Bitcoin project’s lead developer, he is an obvious choice (though perhaps too obvious by Satoshi’s standards). Andresen serves as chief scientist on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation and equivalent of the Linux’s Linus Torvalds. Outside of Satoshi, Andresen has the most influence on Bitcoin’s direction. The mild-mannered programmer’s technical savvy and work ethic is universally admired within the community.</p>



<p>He has sometimes been referred to as Bitcoin’s “Batman” for his altruism and the nature of his often unrewarding role. One Bitcoin developer who has frequently corresponded with Andresen but wished to remain anonymous, claims conversational similarities between the two, though this has been disputed. Could Satoshi be hiding in plain sight?</p>



<p>Andresen denied being Satoshi when we broached the question over the weekend at the 2013 Bitcoin conference in San Jose, saying he has a different coding style than Satoshi does.</p>



<p><strong>Michael Clear, Donal O’Mahony, Hitesh Tewari and Michael Peirce of Trinity College, Dublin</strong>: An investigation by Joshua Davis of the New Yorker ultimately led to Michael Clear, a then 23-year-old graduate student in cryptography at Trinity College. Despite his age, Clear appeared to check enough boxes to fit the bill. Named Trinity’s top computer science student in 2008, Clear had co-authored a paper on peer-to-peer cryptography. He was also British. Davis tracked Clear down at the Crytpo 2011 conference in Santa Barbara where Clear denied the allegations. “I&#8217;m not Satoshi,” he said. “But even if I was I wouldn&#8217;t tell you.” (That refrain is common in the Satoshi search.)</p>



<p>Davis’s report prompted further digging among the community, which led to Donal O’Mahony, a professor at the university; Hitesh Tewari, a research assistant; and Michael Peirce, a student, because of various published materials connecting the four including this paper and this book. Along with Clear, the group has been called the Crypto Mano Group (mano is Irish for coin) or CMG. Perhaps coincidentally, none have publicly discussed Bitcoin in spite of their relevant body of work.</p>



<p><strong>Neal J. King, Charles Bry, and Vladamir Oksman</strong>: The New Yorker piece prompted Adam L. Penenberg of Fast Company to conduct his own search for Bitcoin’s mysterious creator. A textual analysis of Satoshi’s whitepaper led Penenberg to a patent application, which shared the term &#8220;computationally impractical to reverse.&#8221; To Penenberg’s surprise, the patent had been filed just three days before the domain Bitcoin.org was registered.</p>



<p>All three have filed patent applications that have to do with encryption, communication, networks, and nodes. All three have also denied being Satoshi, with King going as far as shooting down the concept. “It’s not a very good idea,” King told Penenberg. “Nakamoto’s algorithm is a solution in search of a problem.”</p>



<p>King has been consistent with his skepticism. His latest comment at the Economist continues his argument as to why Bitcoin won’t work: “It never makes contact with the physical world, except through the concepts of credulous dreamers that have not quite woken up.” Knowing Satoshi, however, it could be a ploy to cover his tracks.</p>



<p><strong>Jed McCaleb</strong>: McCaleb’s name is often brought up during discussions of Satoshi’s identity. The UC Berkeley dropout co-founded Mt. Gox, which is based in Tokyo—a questionable decision given Japan’s high corporate tax rate and regulatory red tape. This has led some to cite this as evidence of a tenuous affinity for the country without McCaleb actually being Japanese. McCaleb also founded eDonkey in 2000, one of the largest (and technically revered) peer-to-peer file-sharing networks at the time.</p>



<p>He would later sell the highly profitable Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, saying that while the service was “cool and needed to exist,” it was no longer “technically interesting.” Once an enthusiastic Bitcoin supporter, McCaleb had also become disillusioned by the protocol’s system of mining “because it wastes so much energy.” He would go on to develop Ripple, what he believes to be an improved iteration of the Bitcoin concept that addresses some of these flaws. Could this have been what Satoshi meant when he said he had “moved on”?</p>



<p><strong>Shinichi Mochizuki</strong>: A recent feature on the Japanese mathematician has prompted Nelson, among others, to speculate that the eccentric genius had, while solving the famed ABC Conjecture, one of math world’s most complex problems, created Bitcoin in his spare time. It’s tough to question Mochizuki’s abilities and the patterns seem to fit.</p>



<p>Like Satoshi, Mochizuki released his ABC Conjecture proof on the internet (instead of established academic channels) and simply walked away, refusing to explain his potentially historic work to the great frustration of mathematicians everywhere. Mochizuki is also a native English speaker, though it’s unclear if he can code or is knowledgeable in cryptography. But given Mochizuki’s mathematics acumen and incredible smarts, it’s not impossible to believe he taught himself along the way.</p>



<p><strong>Government</strong>: A conspiracy theorist’s wet dream, another idea that gets tossed around is that Bitcoin is the product of some government or governmental agency. From that vantage point, resources are no longer an issue. But why? The answer is more of an intellectual exercise than actual theory.</p>



<p>Bitcoin could be used as a weapon against the US dollar. It could be used to fund black ops, sort of like a currency version of onion routing, which was first developed by the Naval Research Laboratory. It could be used to strategically trim the overweight financial sector.</p>



<p>If governments believed a widely used digital currency was inevitable, Bitcoin could be a preemptive strike against a potentially malevolent iteration. From the US perspective, it could have been created as a hedge against the waning international power of the dollar, though given the Fed’s policies of quantitative easing, this seems unlikely. The same could be said about the EU and the flailing euro. Along these lines, some have pointed to EU directives on digital currencies that were implemented and voted for well before Bitcoin became widely known as a possible clue.</p>



<p>Perhaps the scariest theory of all is that Bitcoin is actually an Orwellian vehicle that would allow governments to monitor all financial transactions. Bitcoin is often touted for its anonymity, but the transparent nature of the blockchain means every transaction is potentially traceable. Even if each transaction is only associated with a key, armed with enough information, certain organizations would eventually be able to connect the dots. In theory, anyway. In reality, government involvement isn&#8217;t likely, though by no means an impossibility.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size">WHAT WE DON’T KNOW</h3>



<p>In the end, we’re right back where we started: a few theories, some circumstantial evidence, and nothing remotely conclusive. It takes only brief examination of his essentially perfect execution of the Bitcoin protocol to realize that Satoshi Nakamoto would treat his quest for privacy with the same level of comprehension. He is a master of the long game.</p>



<p>And no wonder. The creators of e-gold were charged with &#8220;conspiracy to engage in money laundering&#8221; and the &#8220;operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business&#8221; in July of 2008, just months before Satoshi unveiled Bitcoin. Given the treatment of guys like Julian Assange and Kim Dotcom, there’s little upside to being an internet hero when your platform has the potential to disrupt governments and big business.</p>



<blockquote><h3>&#8220;His word is pretty much bond, especially if he were to come out from reclusiveness after all those years.&#8221;</h3></blockquote>



<p>There is the possibility that Satoshi could make a comeback at some point. Some within the community assume he is keeping an eye on things, but could re-emerge, if necessary, to right the ship.</p>



<p>“He could kind of step in and say, ‘This is bad.’ It could happen,” a Bitcoin developer told me. “And he would absolutely have enough sway. His word is pretty much bond, especially if he were to come out from reclusiveness after all those years.”</p>



<p>Satoshi could then verify it was him by signing a message to one of his keys from his genesis block. Until then, it’s clear he’s quite content keeping his identity a secret.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The postcard contained only two words: “Hurry up.”</h1>
<p>John Archibald Wheeler, a 33-year-old physicist, was in Hanford, Wash., working on the nuclear reactor that was feeding plutonium to Los Alamos, when he received the postcard from his younger brother, Joe. It was late summer, 1944. Joe was fighting on the front lines of World War II in Italy. He had a good idea what his older brother was up to. He knew that five years earlier, Wheeler had sat down with Danish scientist Niels Bohr and worked out the physics of nuclear fission, showing that unstable isotopes of elements like uranium or soon-to-be-discovered plutonium would, when bombarded with neutrons, split down the seams, releasing unimaginable stores of atomic energy. Enough to flatten a city. Enough to end a war.</p>
<p>After the postcard’s arrival, Wheeler worked as quickly as he could, and the Manhattan Project completed its construction of the atomic bomb the following summer. Over the Jornada del Muerto Desert in New Mexico, physicists detonated the first nuclear explosion in human history, turning 1,000 feet of desert sand to glass. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the project’s director, watched from the safety of a base camp 10 miles away and silently quoted Hindu scripture from the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” In Hanford, Wheeler was thinking something different: I hope I’m not too late. He didn’t know that on a hillside near Florence, lying in a foxhole, Joe was already dead.</p>
<p>When Wheeler learned the news, he was devastated. He blamed himself. “One cannot escape the conclusion that an atomic bomb program started a year earlier and concluded a year sooner would have spared 15 million lives, my brother Joe’s among them,” he wrote in his memoir. “I could—probably—have influenced the decision makers if I had tried.”</p>
<p>Time. As a physicist, Wheeler had always been curious to untangle the nature of that mysterious dimension. But now, in the wake of Joe’s death, it was personal.</p>
<p>Wheeler would spend the rest of his life struggling against time. His journals, which he always kept at hand (and which today are stashed, unpublished, in the archives of the American Philosophical Society Library in Philadelphia), reveal a stunning portrait of an obsessed thinker, ever-aware of his looming mortality, caught in a race against time to answer not a question, but the question: “How come existence?”</p>
<p>“Of all obstacles to a thoroughly penetrating account of existence, none looms up more dismayingly than ‘time,’” Wheeler wrote. “Explain time? Not without explaining existence. Explain existence? Not without explaining time.”</p>
<p>As the years raced on, Wheeler’s journal entries about time grew more frequent and urgent, their lines shakier. In one entry, he quoted the Danish scientist and poet Piet Hein:</p>
<p>“I’d like to know<br />
what this whole show<br />
is all about<br />
before it’s out.”</p>
<p>Before his curtain came down, Wheeler changed our understanding of time more radically than any thinker before him or since—a change driven by the memory of his brother, a revolution fueled by regret.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Wheeler was thinking: I hope I’m not too late. He didn’t know that on a hillside near Florence, lying in a foxhole, Joe was already dead.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1905, six years before Wheeler was born, Einstein formulated his theory of special relativity. He discovered that time does not flow at a steady pace everywhere for everyone; instead, it’s relative to the motion of an observer. The faster you go, the slower time goes. If you could go as fast as light, you’d see time come to a halt and disappear.</p>
<p>But in the years following Einstein’s discovery, the formulation of quantum mechanics led physicists to the opposite conclusion about time. Quantum systems are described by mathematical waves called wavefunctions, which encode the probabilities for finding the system in any given state upon measurement. But the wavefunction isn’t static. It changes. It evolves in time. Time, in other words, is defined outside the quantum system, an external clock that ticks away second after absolute second, in direct defiance of Einstein.</p>
<p>That’s where things stood—the two theories in a stalemate, the nature of time up in the air—when Wheeler first came onto the physics scene in the 1930s. As he settled into an academic career at Princeton University, Wheeler was soft-spoken and impossibly polite, donning neatly pressed suits and ties. But behind his conservative demeanor lay a fearlessly radical mind. Raised by a family of librarians, Wheeler was a voracious reader. As he struggled with thorny problems in general relativity and quantum mechanics, he consulted not only Einstein and Bohr but the novels of Henry James and the poetry of Spanish writer Antonio Machado. He lugged a thesaurus in his suitcase when he travelled.</p>
<p>Wheeler’s first inkling that time wasn’t quite what it seemed came one night in the spring of 1940 at Princeton. He was thinking about positrons. Positrons are the antiparticle alter egos of electrons: same mass, same spin, opposite charge. But why should such alter egos exist at all? When the idea struck, Wheeler called his student Richard Feynman and announced, “They are all the same particle!”</p>
<p>Imagine there’s only one lone electron in the whole universe, Wheeler said, winding its way through space and time, tracing paths so convoluted that this single particle takes on the illusion of countless particles, including positrons. A positron, Wheeler declared, is just an electron moving backwards in time. (A good-natured Feynman, in his acceptance speech for the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics, said he stole that idea from Wheeler.)</p>

Corbis Images</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>After working on the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, Wheeler was eager to get back to Princeton and theoretical physics. Yet his return was delayed. In 1950, still haunted by his failure to act quickly enough to save his brother, he joined physicist Edward Teller in Los Alamos to build a weapon even deadlier than the atomic bomb—the hydrogen bomb. On November 1, 1952, Wheeler was on board the S.S. Curtis, about 35 miles from the island of Elugelab in the Pacific. He watched the U.S. detonate an H-bomb with 700 times the energy of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. When the test was over, so was the island of Elugelab.</p>
<p>With his work at Los Alamos complete, Wheeler “fell in love with general relativity and gravitation.” Back at Princeton, just down the street from Einstein’s home, he stood at a chalkboard and gave the first course ever taught on the subject. General relativity described how mass could warp spacetime into strange geometries that we call gravity. Wheeler wanted to know just how strange those geometries could get. As he pushed the theory to its limits, he became fascinated by an object that seemed to turn time on its head. It was called an Einstein-Rosen bridge, and it was a kind of tunnel that carves out a cosmic shortcut, connecting distant points in spacetime so that by entering one end and emerging from the other, one could travel faster than light or backward in time. Wheeler, who loved language, knew that one could breathe life into obscure convolutions of mathematics by giving them names; in 1957, he gave this warped bit of reality a name: wormhole.</p>
<p>As he pushed further through spacetime, he came upon another gravitational anomaly, a place where mass is so densely packed that gravity grows infinitely strong and spacetime infinitely mangled. This, too, he gave a name: black hole. It was a place where “time” lost all meaning, as if it never existed in the first place. “Every black hole brings an end to time,” Wheeler wrote.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>As he pushed further through spacetime, Wheeler came upon another gravitational anomaly. This, too, he gave a name: black hole.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 1960s, as the Vietnam War tore the fabric of American culture, Wheeler struggled to mend a rift in physics between general relativity and quantum mechanics—a rift called time. One day in 1965, while waiting out a layover in North Carolina, Wheeler asked his colleague Bryce DeWitt to keep him company for a few hours at the airport. In the terminal, Wheeler and DeWitt wrote down an equation for a wavefunction, which Wheeler called the Einstein-Schrödinger equation, and which everyone else later called the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. (DeWitt eventually called it “that damned equation.”)</p>
<p>Instead of a wavefunction describing some system of particles moving around in a lab, Wheeler and DeWitt’s wavefunction described the whole universe. The only problem was where to put the clock. They couldn’t put it outside the universe, because the universe, by definition, has no outside. So while their equation successfully combined the best of both relativity and quantum theory, it also described a universe that couldn’t evolve—a frozen universe, stuck in a single, eternal instant.</p>
<p>Wheeler’s work on wormholes had already shown him that, like electrons and positrons, we too might be capable of bending and breaking time’s arrow. Meanwhile his work on the physics of black holes had led him to suspect that time, deep down, does not exist. Now, at the Raleigh International Airport, that damned equation left Wheeler with a nagging hunch that time couldn’t be a fundamental ingredient of reality. It had to be, as Einstein said, a stubbornly persistent illusion, a result of the fact that we are stuck inside a universe that only has an inside.</p>
<p>Wheeler was convinced the central clue to the puzzle of existence—and in turn of time—was quantum measurement. He saw that the profound strangeness of quantum theory lies in the fact that when an observer makes a measurement, he doesn’t measure something that already exists in the world. Instead, his measurement somehow brings that very thing into existence—a bizarre fact that no one in his right mind would have bought, except that it had been proven again and again with a mind-melting experiment known as the double-slit. It was an experiment that Wheeler could not get out of his head.</p>
<p>In the experiment, single photons are shot from a laser at a screen with two tiny parallel slits, then land on a photographic plate on the other side, where they leave a dot of light. Each photon has a 50/50 chance of passing through either slit, so after many rounds of this, you’d expect to see two big blobs of light on the plate, one showing the pile of photons that passed through slit A and the other showing the pile that passed through slit B. You don’t. Instead you see a series of black and white stripes—an interference pattern. “Watching this actual experiment in progress makes vivid the quantum behavior,” Wheeler wrote. “Simple though it is in concept, it strikingly brings out the mind-bending strangeness of quantum theory.”</p>
<p>As impossible as it sounds, the interference pattern can only mean one thing: each photon went through both slits simultaneously. As the photon heads toward the screen, it is described by a quantum wavefunction. At the screen, the wavefunction splits in two. The two versions of the same photon travel through each slit, and when they emerge on the other side, their wavefunctions recombine—only now they are partially out of phase. Where the waves align, the light is amplified, producing stripes of bright light on the plate. Where they are out of sync, the light cancels itself out, leaving stripes of darkness.</p>
<p>Things get even stranger, however, when you try to catch the photons passing through the slits. Place a detector at each slit and run the experiment again, photon after photon. Dot by dot, a pattern begins to emerge. It’s not the stripes. There are two big blobs on the plate, one opposite each slit. Each photon took only one path at a time. As if it knows it’s being watched.</p>
<p>Photons, of course, don’t know anything. But by choosing which property of a system to measure, we determine the state of the system. If we don’t ask which path the photon takes, it takes both. Our asking creates the path.</p>
<p>Could the same idea be scaled up, Wheeler wondered. Could our asking about the origin of existence, about the Big Bang and 13.8 billion years of cosmic history, could that create the universe? “Quantum principle as tiny tip of giant iceberg, as umbilicus of the world,” Wheeler scrawled in his journal on June 27, 1974. “Past present and future tied more intimately than one realizes.”</p>
<p>In his journal, Wheeler drew a picture of a capital-U for “universe,” with a giant eye perched atop the left-hand peak, staring across the letter’s abyss to the tip of the right-hand side: the origin of time. As you follow the swoop of the U from right to left, time marches forward and the universe grows. Stars form and then die, spewing their carbon ashes into the emptiness of space. In a corner of the sky, some carbon lands on a rocky planet, merges into some primordial goo, grows, evolves until … an eye! The universe has created an observer and now, in an act of quantum measurement, the observer looks back and creates the universe. Wheeler scribbled a caption beneath the drawing: “The universe as a self-excited system.”</p>
<p>The problem with the picture, Wheeler knew, was that it conflicted with our most basic understanding of time. It was one thing for electrons to zip backward through time, or for wormholes to skirt time’s arrow. It was something else entirely to talk about creation and causation. The past flows to the present and then the present turns around and causes the past?</p>
<p>“Have to come through to a resolution of these issues, whatever the cost,” Wheeler wrote in his journal. “Nowhere more than here can I try to live up to my responsibilities to mankind living and dead, to [his wife] Janette and my children and grandchildren; to the child that might have been but was not; to Joe…” He glued into the journal a newspaper clipping from The Daily Telegraph. The headline read: “Days are Getting Shorter.”</p>
<p>In 1979, Wheeler gave a lecture at the University of Maryland in which he proposed a bold new thought experiment, one that would become the most dramatic application of his ideas about time: the delayed choice.</p>
<p>Wheeler had realized that it would be possible to arrange the usual double slit experiment in such a way that the observer can decide whether he wants to see stripes or blobs—that is, he can create a bit of reality—after the photon has already passed through the screen. At the last possible second, he can choose to remove the photographic plate, revealing two small telescopes: one pointed at the left slit, the other at the right. The telescopes can tell which slit the photon has passed through. But if the observer leaves the plate in place, the interference pattern forms. The observer’s delayed choice determines whether the photon has taken one path or two after it has presumably already done one or the other.</p>
<p>For Wheeler, this wasn’t a mere curiosity. This was a clue to the universe’s existence. It was the mechanism he needed to get his U-drawing to work, a bending of the rules of time that might allow the universe—one that was born in a Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago—to be created right now. By us.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_235" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-235" style="width: 733px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2247_df1f1d20ee86704251795841e6a9405a.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-235" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2247_df1f1d20ee86704251795841e6a9405a.png" alt="ILLUSTRATION BY WESLEY ALLSBROOK" width="733" height="977"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-235" class="wp-caption-text">ILLUSTRATION BY WESLEY ALLSBROOK</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>To see the point, Wheeler said, just take the delayed choice experiment and scale it up. Imagine light traveling toward Earth from a quasar a billion light years away. A massive galaxy sits between the quasar and the Earth, diverting the light’s path with its gravitational field like a lens. The light bends around the galaxy, skirting either left or right with equal probability and, for the sake of the thought experiment, arrives on Earth a single photon at a time. Again we are faced with a similar choice: We can center a photographic plate at the light’s arrival spot, where an interference pattern will gradually emerge, or we can point our telescope to the left or right of the galaxy to see which path the light took. Our choice determines which of two mutually exclusive histories the photon lived. We determine its route (or routes) start to finish, right now—despite the fact that it began its journey a billion years ago.</p>
<p>Listening intently in the audience was a physicist named Carroll Alley. Alley had known Wheeler in Princeton, where he had studied under the physicist Robert Henry Dicke, whose research group had come up with the idea of putting mirrors on the moon.</p>
<p>Dicke and his team were interested in studying general relativity by looking at subtle gravitational interactions between the moon and the Earth, which would require exquisitely accurate measurements of the distance to the moon as it swept along its orbit. They realized if they could put mirrors on the lunar surface, they could bounce lasers off of them and time how long it took the light to return. Alley became the principle investigator of the NASA project and got three mirrors on the moon; the first one was set down in 1969 by Neil Armstrong.</p>
<p>Now, as Alley listened to Wheeler speak, it dawned on him that he might be able to use the same techniques he had used for measuring laser light bouncing off the moon to realize Wheeler’s vision in the lab. The light signals returning from the mirrors on the moon had been so weak that Alley and his team had developed sophisticated ways to measure single photons, which was exactly what Wheeler’s delayed choice setup required.</p>
<p>In 1984, Alley—along with Oleg Jakubowicz and William Wickes, both of whom had also been in the audience that day—finally got the experiment to run. It worked just as Wheeler had imagined: measurements made in the present can create the past. Time as we once knew it does not exist; past does not come indelibly before future. History, Wheeler discovered—the kind that brews guilt, the kind that lies dormant in foxholes—is never set in stone.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Later that year, he wrote, “How come existence? How come the quantum? Is death the penalty for raising such a question?”</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, some fundamental insight eluded Wheeler. He knew that quantum measurement allowed observers in the present to create the past, the universe hoisting itself into existence by its bootstraps. But how did quantum measurement do it? And if time was not a primordial category, why was it so relentless? Wheeler’s journals became a postcard of their own, written again and again to himself. Hurry up. The puzzle of existence taunted him. “I am not ‘I’ unless I continue to hammer at that nut,” he wrote. “Stop and I become a shrunken old man. Continue and I have a gleam in my eye.”</p>
<p>In 1988, Wheeler’s health was wavering; he had already undergone cardiac surgery two years before. Now, his doctors gave him an expiration date. They told him he could expect to live for another three to five years. Under the threat of his own mortality, Wheeler grew despondent, worried that he would not solve the mystery of existence in time to even the score for what he saw his personal failure to save his brother. Under the heading “Apology,” he wrote in his journal, “It will take years of work to develop these ideas. I—76—don’t have them.”</p>
<p>Luckily, like scientists before them, the doctors had gotten the nature of time all wrong. The gleam in Wheeler’s eye continued to shine, and he hammered away at the mystery of quantum mechanics and the strange loops of time. “Behind the glory of the quantum—shame,” he wrote on June 11, 1999. “Why shame? Because we still don’t understand how come the quantum. Quantum as signal of self-created universe?” Later that year, he wrote, “How come existence? How come the quantum? Is death the penalty for raising such a question—”</p>
<p>Although Wheeler’s journals reveal a driven man on a lonely quest, his influence was widespread. In recent years, Stephen Hawking, along with his collaborator Thomas Hertog of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the KU Leuven in Belgium, has been developing an approach known as top-down cosmology, a direct descendant of Wheeler’s delayed choice. Just as photons from a distant quasar take multiple paths simultaneously when no one’s looking, the universe, Hawking and Hertog argue, has multiple histories. And just as observers can make measurements that determine a photon’s history stretching back billions of years, the history of the universe only becomes reality when an observer makes a measurement. By applying the laws of quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole, Hawking carries the torch that Wheeler lit that day back at the North Carolina airport, and challenges every intuition we have about time in the process. The top-down approach “leads to a profoundly different view of cosmology,” Hawking wrote, “and the relation between cause and effect.” It’s exactly what Wheeler had been driving at when he drew the eye atop his self-creating universe.</p>
<p>In 2003, Wheeler was still chasing the meaning of existence. “I am as far as can be imagined from being able to speak so reasonably about ‘How come existence’!” he wrote in his journal. “Not much time left to find out!”</p>
<p>On April 13, 2008, in Hightstown, N.J., at the age of 96, John Archibald Wheeler finally lost his race against time. That stubbornly persistent illusion.</p>

<h3>The biggest lie about the future is that it&#8217;s going to look much different from today.</h3>



<p>I mean, <em>The Jetsons</em> and <em>Futurama</em> are one thing, but in near-future portrayals—those shown in goofball blockbusters like <em>I, Robot</em> and <em>Minority Report</em>—the world is given a glossy, high-tech makeover. These futuristic landscapes suggest we&#8217;re about to see a bevy of unfathomably large infrastructure investments that will reshape our cities in the next couple decades.</p>



<p>Now take a look outside at your nearest bombed-out road or crumbling bridge. Yeah, your metropolis isn&#8217;t going to be turning into Emerald City any time soon.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s actually going to happen is already happening now: The future will appear, not in leaps and bounds, but on a moving sidewalk, gliding onward just smoothly enough that it doesn&#8217;t shake you into recognition. It&#8217;s still going to take decades for California to complete its futuristic high-speed rail line, for example; when it arrives, it&#8217;s still going to look like a train.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about environmental aesthetics for the past few days, which corresponds with how long I&#8217;ve had Fernando Barbella&#8217;s <a title="Signs from the near future Tumblr" href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signs from the Near Future</a> open on a browser tab. The Barcelona-based creative director started a Tumblr to investigate how the new technologies we dream of will actually begin to subvert our surroundings—which, in our litigious world, mainly means a planet filled with futuristic warning signs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-nicole-37744-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-644" srcset="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-nicole-37744-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-nicole-37744-300x200.jpg 300w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-nicole-37744-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-nicole-37744-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-nicole-37744-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>&#8220;All selfies taken with your smart contact lenses will be shared in real time with the proper authorities&#8221;. Image: <a href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Signs From The Near Future</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;New materials, mashups between living organisms and nanotechnologies, improved capabilities for formerly &#8216;dumb&#8217; and inanimate things&#8230; There a lot of things going on around us!&#8221; Barbella wrote me in an email.</p>



<p>&#8220;And all these advances can be as exciting as disturbing in a way, at the same time, if we think about it,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The fact is all these things are going to cease being just &#8216;projects&#8217; to became part of our reality at some point soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been conditioned to think of the Future, capital F, as something that&#8217;s going to arrive with a bang. But of course that&#8217;s not true. Pithy sentiments like &#8220;every new day is the future&#8221; or whatever, the future is ever-arriving and always evolving. No one is going to flip a switch and suddenly fill our streets with hovercars. (That&#8217;d be rad though!) But one day you&#8217;re going to see an autonomous taxi for the first time and say, &#8220;No shit, those are here now? Cool.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was going for that point: many years ago, when we were kids, the visions for the future were at least disconnected from reality: flying cars, strange architecture buildings surrounding us, among other out of its time things,&#8221; Barbella said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/christoffer-engstrom-26542-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-641" srcset="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/christoffer-engstrom-26542-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/christoffer-engstrom-26542-300x200.jpg 300w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/christoffer-engstrom-26542-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/christoffer-engstrom-26542-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/christoffer-engstrom-26542-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>&#8220;15% off on synthetic burguers!&#8221;. Image: <a href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Signs From The Near Future</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;The real thing is that [the] future is always part of the present times, in a way, and that&#8217;s why I focused on this approach to a near future where we see these technologies coexisting with us in the most ordinary of environments and places,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Our difficulty in seeing progress as discrete events makes it harder for us to institute checks and balances along the way. It&#8217;s not such an issue for a consumer-facing product like Google Glass; Glass appeared, we all marveled—or scoffed—and now we&#8217;re figuring out new social norms as we go along.</p>



<p>But considering future manifestations of power, such perpetual change is harder to grasp. Take full-body scanners at the airport, or location-based <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/blog/maybe-the-most-orwellian-text-message-ever-sent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government text messages aimed at protestors</a>. Both are very futuristic, concerning things in the abstract, but when actually faced with either, the common response is something more like, &#8220;Wait, they can do this now?&#8221;</p>



<p>If we don&#8217;t accept the future as an endless slog forward, it becomes a lot harder to draw a line in the sand—largely because we&#8217;re still waiting for that line to arrive. And as we wait for that line—and for the courts to rule on cases regarding technology that&#8217;s already out of date—the framework for the future is constantly being laid around us.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="686" src="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristof-vizy-98603-1024x686.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-647" srcset="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristof-vizy-98603-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristof-vizy-98603-300x201.jpg 300w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristof-vizy-98603-768x514.jpg 768w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristof-vizy-98603-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kristof-vizy-98603-2048x1371.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Image: <a href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Signs From The Near Future</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;We will probably never know how worried the people at the top are about the democratization of new technologies, and all the doors and windows and new paths these things are opening for regular Joes like us,&#8221; Barbella said. &#8220;So we can clearly imagine this near future full of warnings and signs telling us how—or when—to use or not to use these technologies originally designed to improve our lives.&#8221;</p>



<p>Barbella said that as the project continues, he hopes to cross it over into the physical world, either with a book or a show, or perhaps by producing signs for real and &#8220;start doing some urban interventions.&#8221; He also said that, despite his project standing as a reminder that we need to wake up with regards to our progress, he maintains a positive outlook on the world to come.</p>



<p>&#8220;The whole responsibility is on us. Not the governments, not the monstrous corporations. They just care about themselves, about being reelected or the bonus they will see at the end of the year,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;We should always be aware that while we waste time on social media, or going after the latest techno toy, there are people who may need our help, and perhaps we can use both the existing and emerging technologies to do it.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Archeology is often viewed as a painstaking science involving scalpels, toothbrushes, and methodically detailed notes. Well, to a large extent, that remains an accurate perception. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that lasers can&#8217;t be thrown into the mix too.</h3>



<p>The <a title="Global Heritage Found" href="http://www.globalheritagefund.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Heritage Fund</a>, a non-profit based in Silicon Valley, is eager to employ novel technological approaches to the evergreen problem of protecting cultural history. Since the organization was founded in 2001, they have used LIDAR laser technology, ground-penetrating radar, satellite maps, and crowdsourcing to help preserve and promote heritage sites.</p>



<p>I spoke with Executive Director Vince Michael about how these methods have helped Global Heritage Fund achieve its primary goal: encouraging communities to become actively involved in the preservation of their local heritage sites. Be warned: this interview will inspire wanderlust.</p>


<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">How does Global Heritage Fund select its candidate sites?</p>


<p class="ktt-interview-answer">We factor in the community development at the front end. We don&#8217;t adopt a site just based on the fact that it&#8217;s threatened. It would be nice to, because there is plenty of that. But we also look for opportunities for partnerships that can make it a successful project.</p>
<p>Our basic model is this: you can pour all the money you want into a heritage site. But unless the community, its ultimate stewards, benefit from that site, it&#8217;s wasted money. It&#8217;ll be gone in a generation. If you can get the local community to benefit from it, it will be in their interest in the long term, and they&#8217;re the only ones who can preserve it in the long term. Even if your interest is only heritage, the only way to do that is community.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;We track more than 700 sites in the developing world through this crowdsourcing database.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>On the flip side, on the community side, we think about sustainable development. If I build a factory in India, an office building in Malaysia, a store in Guatemala—I can move all those things. I can&#8217;t move the Taj Mahal or the Great Wall of China. So, if I can make a heritage site an economic generator for the community, that&#8217;s permanent and sustainable.</p>


<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">How do lasers help in the preservation of these sites?</p>


<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Global Heritage Fund does both above and below ground heritage sites in developing countries. About half of them are archeological and half are architectural, and interestingly, a lot of laser technology can be used for both.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the traditional approach to archeology is quite destructive. You&#8217;re digging a hole into the past, and you&#8217;re charting everything and recording everything. But you&#8217;re also looking for a needle in a haystack to some extent. Laser technology gives you the opportunity to try to figure out where the needle might be before you start digging.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the advantages of the airborne LIDAR technology. We use close-scale laser technology for actually scanning individual stones in order to reconstruct walls. So, you can actually use this technology at both the macro scale and micro scale.</p>

Image: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe#mediaviewer/File:G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe,_Urfa.jpg">Teomancimit</a>.</figcaption></figure>


<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What other technologies does Global Heritage Fund use?</p>


<p class="ktt-interview-answer">We have used ground-penetrating radar in India, which is a way of scanning the surface to figure out where is the best place to dig. For example, we&#8217;ve [used GPR] at Rakhigarhi in Haryana state. It&#8217;s fascinating because it&#8217;s a Harappan site, which is the Indus River Civilization—the oldest civilization in the world. It&#8217;s also largely unexcavated, and there&#8217;s a community built on top of parts of it. So you really want to be careful to figure out where&#8217;s the best place to dig so you don&#8217;t disturb the community.</p>
<p>Then we also use our database, Global Heritage Network. We track more than 700 sites in the developing world through this crowdsourcing database. People can apply to be a site monitor—they can upload photos of the site, update information, upload reports on the site. So, some of the sites are pretty well documented whereas others could use a site monitor because we&#8217;re depending on local sources.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something we would definitely like to grow and get more people involved with. There are about 1,100-1,200 people involved now that tend to be mostly professionals in the field or people with professional interest in heritage. But there&#8217;s plenty of room for that to grow.</p>


<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You&#8217;re also partnering with another preservation company called Cyark, which can provide 3D imaging of heritage sites. What projects will you be working on together?</p>


<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Cyark is a not-for-profit in Oakland and they do traditional point-cloud renderings, which are done with a base station. These are really precise scans. It&#8217;s a thousand lasers going out, and then in a computer being turned into a full-scale three-dimensional model of something that&#8217;s really big, like Mount Rushmore. We&#8217;re partnering with them on a proposal to scan one of the oldest Peruvian sites in Lima.</p>
<p>The idea is that they could be used by other researchers and scholars. You have permanent documentation of the structure. If anything happens in the future, you have effectively a much more accurate way to reconstruct or preserve [sites] than you would by the traditional methods of drawings or photographs.</p>
<p>Cyark has this plan to do 500 sites across the world. We work at about six to eight major projects each year, and a similar number of what we call investigations which are minor projects that might become major projects later. At each site, we look at the potential for tools we can bring in, what tools we can afford to bring in, and what tools make the most sense.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you get sites and they&#8217;ve already been scanned. For example, Gobekli Tepe in Turkey is an 11,000-year-old site, the world&#8217;s oldest temple, and it has already been scanned. So we didn&#8217;t need to worry about bringing it in on that project. That one, we focused on conservation, development, and security.</p>


<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What is GHF&#8217;s strategy for incentivizing communities to be involved in the conservation of their local heritage sites?</p>


<p class="ktt-interview-answer">We do like to get people involved in the actual conservation and preservation. For example in Banteay Chhmar, in Cambodia, there are local people who have been trained as stonemasons to do restoration. In Turkey, some people are trained in conservation, other people doing security. There are job opportunities.</p>
<p>Tourism is a possibility as well. We&#8217;ve been working with community-based tourist organizations that get people to do home-stays. There&#8217;s a collection of local leaders who form sort of a tourism council that tries to take advantage of tourism opportunities.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>&#8220;The idea is to not just focus on pure &#8216;here&#8217;s a heritage site, let&#8217;s bring tourists.&#8217; Maybe there&#8217;s also intangible heritage locally.&#8221;</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time we&#8217;re very careful not to overdo tourism because you can see plenty of places in the world like Angkor or Machu Picchu where the tourism&#8217;s been overdone. That can ruin the resource, and that kind of tourism leaves out the locals. One of the great ironies is that Angkor, which gets three million visitors a year, is in Siem Reap, which is the poorest province in Cambodia. One of the things we try very hard to do is to figure out what are the best ways to capture any [economic] increase in the local community.</p>
<p>For example, we&#8217;re doing a project in Guizhou, which is the poorest province in China. We&#8217;re working with a local Chinese NGO that helps communities market what they do. So, one community makes silver, another community makes paper, but maybe they need to increase its value a couple times in order to make it sustainable. They figure out a way to do that whether it&#8217;s marketing, or a business, or production techniques.</p>
<p>The idea is to not just focus on pure “here&#8217;s a heritage site, let&#8217;s bring tourists.” Maybe there&#8217;s also intangible heritage locally: things that people do, longtime traditions that also have value either by producing goods and services for a wider market.</p>
<p>Our model is to say: “how can this be part of the regular life of a place? How can we revitalize it; find use for it?” We&#8217;re trying to preserve the past in ways that are useful for the future.</p>
