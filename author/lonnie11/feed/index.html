<p class="has-drop-cap line-height-1dot5 has-normal-font-size"><strong>Early on a Saturday morning 60 years ago, the millennia-old dream of spaceflight came true as Sputnik 1 rocketed into orbit to become Earth&#8217;s first human-made satellite. The mission notoriously shocked the world and minted a new era of human exploration, but what&#8217;s less well-known is that Sputnik arose, in part, from a 19th century dream to raise the dead. Really.</strong></p>

<p class="border-radius-5 box-shadow-large text-shadow-1 has-eee-color has-0693-e-3-background-color has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#0693e3;color:#eee">On this day in 1957, the 184-pound spacecraft departed from a modest Kazakh launchpad that would later evolve into the famous Baikonur Cosmodrome, currently the only spaceport on Earth capable of transporting humans to the International Space Station (ISS). The local time of liftoff was 1:28 AM on October 5, but for people living in North American, European, and Western Russian time zones, the launch occurred on Friday, October 4, and history has memorialized that date as Sputnik&#8217;s anniversary.</p>



<div style="height:24px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Sputnik triggered the Space Race, a geopolitically intense and technologically productive phase of the Cold War, which climaxed with NASA&#8217;s six Apollo Moon landings from 1969 to 1972. The Sputnik crisis, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/sputnik-impact-on-america.html">a period of Western anxiety</a>about the clear Soviet lead in spaceflight—and its reconnaissance and military implications—jumpstarted American defense, science, and education initiatives that profoundly impacted the course of world events over the subsequent six decades.</p>

<p>This explains why the satellite&#8217;s flight is usually framed as the starting shot of a new era, syncing up with the &#8220;space race&#8221; metaphor. Sputnik is remembered for the world it made, not the world that made it. But the run-up to this mission is as fascinating as its fallout, and weaves together the stories of visionary thinkers against the tumultuous backdrop of imperial Russia&#8217;s transition into the communist USSR.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t enough to prevent the death of every living person. Every dead person also had to be brought back to life so they could rejoin their descendents in a utopian future. He called this mission humanity&#8217;s &#8220;common task.&#8221;</p>



<p>In other words, Fyodorov believed that &#8220;humanity&#8217;s moral task was to emulate Christ and make bodily resurrection possible,&#8221; writes Asif Siddiqi, a space historian based at Fordham University, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Rockets-Glare-Spaceflight-Imagination/dp/1107639328">in his book</a> <em>The Red Rockets&#8217; Glare.</em> &#8220;Mass resurrection would finally eliminate the artificial boundaries among the &#8216;brotherhood&#8217; of humanity, that is, between the previous and current generations.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap line-height-1dot5 has-medium-font-size"><strong>Today, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for <em>Gill v. Whitford</em>, in which the state of Wisconsin will argue that congressional redistricting practices are <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/09/if_anthony_kennedy_follows_precedent_he_ll_strike_down_partisan_gerrymandering.html">not subject to judicial oversight</a>. At the core of this hearing is whether partisan gerrymandering—a tactic used by political parties to redraw congressional voting districts so that the voting power within those districts is weighted toward their own party—was used to steal the 2012 state elections in Wisconsin from Democrats. The ramifications of this decision will be felt by the entire country.</strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p>The Supreme Court will be deciding whether or not federal courts have the ability to throw out district maps for being too partisan, which requires the justices to be able to articulate just what constitutes partisan gerrymandering in the first place. The practice of gerrymandering has been a thorn in the side of American democracy for most of our nation&#8217;s existence, but continues largely unabated due to the difficulty of defining the point at which a new congressional district can considered to be the result of partisan gerrymandering.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large site-palette-yin-1-background-color site-palette-yang-1-color border-radius-5 box-shadow-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lance-asper-153771-unsplash-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-652" srcset="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lance-asper-153771-unsplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lance-asper-153771-unsplash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lance-asper-153771-unsplash-768x432.jpg 768w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lance-asper-153771-unsplash-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lance-asper-153771-unsplash-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Look at this caption. Look.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Various solutions to America&#8217;s gerrymandering problem have been proposed over the years, but most of these have failed to gain traction. In September, however, a team of data scientists at the University of Illinois published a&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10589-017-9936-3">paper</a>to little fanfare that offered a novel solution to America&#8217;s gerrymandering woes: Let an algorithm draw the maps.</p>



<p>Although the Illinois researchers, led by computer science professor Sheldon Jacobson, aren&#8217;t the first to propose using artificial intelligence as a solution to the redistricting process, they hope their new approach will be more accessible and fair than previous attempts at stopping gerrymandering with computation.</p>



<p>These computer scientists are motivated by the belief that data and algorithms will create transparency in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/hidden-hands-in-redistricting-corporations-special-interests">notoriously opaque redistricting process</a>&nbsp;by exposing the inputs and parameters that led to redrawing a district a certain way. With these inputs and parameters exposed, data scientists hope this will hopefully incentivize a more equitable redistricting process. Yet they are also the first to acknowledge that the same algorithms that can create equity in congressional redistricting can also be used to gerrymander with unprecedented efficiency.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a group of politicians in a particular state wants to gerrymander the state to favor them, we can incorporate that into our algorithm and come up with districts which will satisfy their political agenda,&#8221; Jacobson told me over the phone. &#8220;We&#8217;re not political scientists trying to create an agenda. We&#8217;re trying to create a tool of transparency.&#8221;</p>



<p>Algorithms are already widely deployed in the service of partisan gerrymandering and are increasingly used as tools to keep gerrymandering in check. Yet for all their pretension to fairness, it&#8217;s far from certain that algorithms are actually creating more equity in the electoral process. This raises a profoundly important question for the future of the American experiment in democracy: If algorithms have been used for the last few decades to fuel gerrymandering, can they also offer a more equitable way forward?</p>



<h2>A Brief History of Gerrymandering</h2>



<p>Every decade, the United States carries out a population census, which among other things,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/aboutcd.html">determines</a>&nbsp;how many seats in the House of Representatives are allotted to each state. It is then up to the states to draw up congressional districts, each of which elects a representative of that district to the House. The way the boundaries of these districts are decided varies from state to state, but a few elements pertain to&nbsp;<a href="http://redistricting.lls.edu/where-state.php">almost every</a>&nbsp;redistricting decision: all parts of a district must be geographically connected and districts ought to follow boundaries for cities, towns or counties. Beyond these common elements, redistricting requirements and processes can vary significantly from state to state. In most cases, the state legislature controls the redistricting process, which means that the party with control over the legislature has the ability to gerrymander, or redraw congressional districts in the interests of that party.</p>



<p>To get a better idea of how this practice can drastically affect elections, imagine a state that has 50 constituents. Of these constituents, let&#8217;s say 30 vote Democrat and 20 vote Republican, and the state has five seats in the House, like in the drawing on the left below:</p>


<p><img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1507057131533-ele.png" alt=""> Image: Steven Nass/&nbsp;</p>


<p>In an ideal system the five congressional districts would be perfectly divided and the constituents of each district all shared the same political affiliations. In other words, the Democrats would get three congressional districts and the Republicans would get two by making each vertical column its own district. But what if Democrats controlled the redistricting process? By dividing the constituencies horizontally, they could ensure that their constituencies are the majority in each district and win all five seats in House. Alternatively, if the Republicans were in control of the legislature, they could redistrict the state so that it has the convoluted boundaries seen in the figure on the far right. Under this plan, three districts are majority Republican and the party would represent a majority of the state in terms of voting power in the House.</p>



<p>Of course in real life the distribution of voters in a state is not so neat, but the general idea behind gerrymandering—and its consequences—remains the same.</p>



<p>According to David Daley, the editor in chief of&nbsp;<em>Salon</em>&nbsp;and author of&nbsp;<em>Ratfucked: The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America&#8217;s Democracy</em>, gerrymandering is also a major source of political stasis in the country. Consider the 2016 election, when 400 of 435 House races were scored as &#8220;safe&#8221; for Democrat and Republican incumbents as a result of gerrymandering. After the election,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2016">only 5</a>seats were transferred to the Democrats from Republicans, and only ten incumbents total lost their seats. Not exactly what you&#8217;d expect at a time when the approval rating for Congress is&nbsp;<a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx">consistently below 20 percent</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Gerrymandering drains away competitive districts,&#8221; Daley told me in an email. &#8220;Uncompetitive districts have made the government responsive only to the extremes. They are a key reason why we can&#8217;t get action even on issues where most Americans agree. When we allow partisans to hijack district lines, we give them the power to hijack democracy itself.&#8221;</p><cite>&#8211; Gandhi</cite></blockquote>



<p>Historically, gerrymandering has&nbsp;<a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/30/gerrymanders-part-1-busting-the-both-sides-do-it-myth/">been disproportionately wielded by GOP candidates</a>&nbsp;to gain influence, but now some establishment Republicans such as Senator John McCain and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are starting to&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/351115-juan-williams-momentum-builds-against-gerrymandering">break ranks</a>&nbsp;over the issue. The main problem is determining a fair way to draw districts and on what grounds districts can be challenged as the illegitimate products of gerrymandering.</p>



<p>A solution adopted by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.azredistricting.org/">Arizona</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.redistricting.wa.gov/">Washington</a>, and<a href="http://aelc.assembly.ca.gov/">&nbsp;California</a>&nbsp;was to establish standing non-partisan committees to preside over congressional redistricting following the 2010 census. This is a method of addressing gerrymandering that has been adopted in the UK and other commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada, but non-partisan committee have been slow to catch on in the United States and aren&#8217;t necessarily as nonpartisan as they seem, according to Daley.</p>



<p>&#8220;Independent commissions are only as good as the criteria they are given to draw districts with, and the people who staff them,&#8221; Daley said. &#8220;Most states fill these commissions with partisans and political appointees. They end up being incumbent protection rackets, or in the case of Arizona, pushing an already secretive process deeper into the shadows.&#8221;</p>



<h2>The Algorithmic Turn</h2>



<p class="has-eee-color has-0693-e-3-background-color has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#0693e3;color:#eee">The idea to apply computers to the redistricting process as a way to foster transparency and equity was&nbsp;first considered&nbsp;over half-a-century ago in 1961, and in 1965 an algorithm had been described that offered &#8220;simplified bipartisan computer redistricting.&#8221;</p>



<p>By the time the 1990 census rolled around, algorithms had become&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439305275855">the norm</a>&nbsp;for legislators and special interest groups hoping to get a leg up during the redistricting process, although fears about the effects of computers on redistricting processes were already being felt in the early 1980s. A 1981&nbsp;<a href="https://m.csmonitor.com/1981/0427/042749.html">article</a>in the&nbsp;<em>Christian Science Monitor</em>&nbsp;captured the spirit of the times, noting that &#8220;even those states that have taken the redistricting process either entirely or substantially out of the hands of state lawmakers are hesitant to step aside and let an impersonal, high-speed machine take over.&#8221;</p>



<p>The panic, it seems, was short lived. In 1989,&nbsp;<em>The New York Times&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/10/us/new-age-of-gerrymandering-political-magic-by-computer.html?mcubz=3">reported</a>&nbsp;that &#8220;a profusion of new computer technology will make it possible for any political hack to be a political hacker.&#8221; The article describes how at least 10 vendors were developing computer programs at the time that could be used by &#8220;politicians, their aides, and special interest groups as well as official redistricting commissions&#8230;to produce their own detailed versions of proposed election districts.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the last thirty years, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/crc_Brace.pdf">ever-growing suite of digital redistricting tools</a>&nbsp;have become available to those with the technical knowledge and funds to wield this proprietary software. Although these algorithms were able to generate dozens of sophisticated district maps in a fraction of the time it would&#8217;ve taken a human to draw just one, they did little to actually solve America&#8217;s gerrymandering problem. Instead, these algorithms simply made it easier for politicians to create maps that served the interest of their party.</p>



<p>Are you a politician that needs to create district maps that favor Republicans in Wisconsin? No, problem—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/magazine/the-new-front-in-the-gerrymandering-wars-democracy-vs-math.html?mcubz=3">the algorithm&#8217;s got you covered</a>.</p>



<h2>The Algorithms Strike Back</h2>



<p>In 2016, Wendy Cho and her colleagues at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (a different team than the one led by Jacobson) developed a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/news/story/blue_waters_supercomputer_used_to_develop_a_standard_for_partisan_gerrymand">complex algorithm</a>&nbsp;that uses a supercomputer to generate hundreds of millions of possible district configurations in a matter of hours. The tool was designed to test an enticing idea: what if it were possible to generate every possible district map for a given state, and then use this set of all possible maps to judge the level of partisanship on an officially proposed district map? This tool would essentially be able to quantify the fairness of a given map against the set of every possible map. The only problem is that generating a set of all possible maps is, practically speaking, impossible due to the astronomically large number of potential maps.</p>



<p>Yet as Cho and her colleagues discovered, generating all possible maps isn&#8217;t necessary to achieve their intended goal. Rather, their algorithm whittled the number of necessary maps down to a much more manageable number: about 800 million per state. By using these hundreds of millions of maps as a point of comparison, Cho and her colleagues could statistically expose bias in redistricting procedures.</p>



<p>The downside is that these sorts of technologies are too inaccessible and expensive for general public use because it requires a supercomputer to run. Furthermore, Cho&#8217;s algorithm is better deployed after the fact to determine the degree that a given district map is the result of partisan gerrymandering. If algorithms stand any chance of saving America&#8217;s democracy from gerrymandering, the use of the algorithms and the code they use will also have to be accessible to all.</p>



<p>In this regard, the past decade has been something of a renaissance era for&nbsp;<a href="http://bdistricting.com/about.html#other">algorithmic redistricting</a>. Take, for example,&nbsp;<a href="http://bdistricting.com/2010/">Bdistricting</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://autoredistrict.org/">Auto-Redistrict</a>, two free open source programs that can be used to generate ostensibly fair, unbiased congressional districts without requiring a supercomputer. There are subtle differences between the types of algorithms these programs use to generate district maps, but both are characterized as local search metaheuristics. This is basically a fancy way of saying that the algorithms manipulate tiny elements within a given domain over thousands of iterations until they arrive at an optimal result.</p>



<p>&#8220;A computer can&#8217;t decide the criteria for creating a district, but it can create districts based on these criteria better than any human could do.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the case of gerrymandering, the tiny elements being manipulated by local search algorithms are census blocks, the smallest areas of a given state for which census data (such as population size) is available. There are over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tallies/census_block_tally.html">11 million census blocks</a>&nbsp;in the US, and each state has at least 24,000 census blocks. These algorithms basically switch the positions of these census blocks one at a time according to certain parameters (the census blocks for a given district must be contiguous, for example, or should contain the same population sizes) until an optimal solution has been reached.</p>



<p>The new algorithm released last month by the Jacobson and his colleagues at the University of Illinois improves on these local search algorithms by adding a structural element called a geo-graph. Whereas other redistricting algorithms, such as Bdistricting or Auto-Redistrict start by essentially randomly generating districts and then tweaking them over thousands of iterations, Jacobson&#8217;s algorithm first analyzes the data in census blocks, which might be imagined as spread out on a graph before the computer, and then uses this data to create congressional districts optimized for certain goals.</p>



<p>&#8220;Both Bdistricing and Auto-Redistrict appear to be great tools, incorporate a variety of objectives, and can create fair districts,&#8221; Jacobson told me in an email. &#8220;But geo-graphs make each local search iteration step highly efficient. This means that what may take them hours, we can do in minutes on a laptop.&#8221;</p>



<p>The problem, however, is that although the algorithms themselves are entirely apolitical—their only goal is to find the optimal solution to a problem given a certain data set and parameters—the process of determining what parameters should be fed to the algorithm is still hopelessly mired in the all too human world of politics.</p>



<p>&#8220;Although the criteria for districts is a political issue, creating these districts is not,&#8221; Jacobson told me. &#8220;A computer can&#8217;t decide the criteria for creating a district, but it can create districts based on these criteria better than any human could do. Ultimately, this is an algorithmic data problem.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Who Programs the Programmers?</h2>



<p>On the surface, it seems that defining parameters that automatically lead to fair districts would be relatively straightforward. Bdistricting, for instance, generated district maps that were &#8220;optimized for equal population and compactness only.&#8221; The idea here is that these two criteria are free from &#8220;partisan power plays&#8221; since they&#8217;re based on metrics that have nothing to do with politics. But as the San Francisco-based programmer Chris Fedor labored to show, unbiased districts don&#8217;t necessarily result in&nbsp;<em>fair</em>&nbsp;districts. As Fedor detailed in a&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@raulfoo/in-defense-of-gerrymandering-politics-as-usual-is-better-than-bad-math-92b89b3f0b43">Medium post</a>, algorithmically optimizing district boundaries for compactness (such as Bdistricting) or randomly generating the boundaries actually leads to districts that are&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;gerrymandered than the boundaries drafted up by politicians.</p>



<p>&#8220;Algorithms can hide as much as they reveal,&#8221; Micah Altman, a professor of computer science at MIT, told me in an email. &#8220;Technical choices in an algorithm, how one formalizes criteria, and software implementation can have tremendous implications, but are much more difficult for non-experts to review than comparison of maps and their consequences.&#8221;</p>



<p>This point is further reinforced in a 2010&nbsp;<a href="http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=djclpp">paper</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em>Duke Journal of Constitutional Law and Public Policy</em>&nbsp;by Altman and the University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald, which analyzed several trends in the application of digital technologies to the redistricting process. In the case of Bdistricting and Auto-Redistrict, these programs belong to a class of algorithms that seek to automate the redistricting process entirely. Yet as the authors of the paper point out, these types of algorithms run up against some fundamental limits. Creating optimally compact, contiguous, and equal-population districts belong to a class of math-problems described as &#8220;<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/4x385b/the-world-is-knapsack-problem-and-were-just-living-in-it">NP-hard</a>,&#8221; which basically means that there isn&#8217;t an algorithm that can solve the problem both quickly and correctly in all possible cases.</p>



<p>A way to get around the NP-hardness of redistricting is to approach the problem heuristically, which is a fancy way of saying that a computer can solve the problem, but not necessarily in the most optimal or perfect way. As the Altman and McDonald describe them, these heuristic algorithms are &#8220;problem-solving procedures that, while they may yield acceptable results in practice, provide no guarantees of yielding good solutions in general. Specifically, an algorithm is heuristic if it cannot be shown to yield a correct result, or correct within a known error or approximation or having a known probability of correctness.&#8221; Every attempt at automated redistricting—including all of the algorithms mentioned above—have relied on heuristics.</p>



<p>As Altman and McDonald acknowledge, the computational limits of the redistricting problem could be addressed if the non-partisan criteria for redistricting was greatly simplified and ranked (for instance, equal populations are more important than compactness, contiguity more important than the rest, etc.). Yet so far, anything close to a standard for measuring fair districts is lacking and this very issue has been at the heart of landmark Supreme Court cases considering gerrymandering.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<em>Gill v. Whitford</em>&nbsp;case being heard at the Supreme Court Tuesday is a challenge to the 1986 Supreme Court ruling in&nbsp;<em>Davis v. Bandemer</em>&nbsp;that claimed partisan gerrymandering is able to be subjected to judicial oversight, although the court was divided on just what constituted judicial standards in challenges to partisan gerrymandering.</p>



<p>&#8220;Algorithms are a terrific tool and there could definitely be a role for them, but they are only as good as the criteria that govern them.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Justice Byron White wrote in his opinion on the&nbsp;<em>Bandemer</em>&nbsp;case, a &#8220;group&#8217;s electoral power is not unconstitutionally diminished by the fact that an apportionment scheme makes winning elections more difficult, and a failure of proportional representation alone does not constitute discrimination.&#8221; According to White, discrimination in gerrymandering &#8220;only occurs when the electoral system is arranged in a manner that will consistently degrade a voter&#8217;s or a group of voters&#8217; influence on the political system as a whole.&#8221;</p>



<p>The inability of the Supreme Court to decide on standards with which to judge cases challenging partisan gerrymandering was the justification in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1580.ZC.html">2004 Supreme Court case</a>&nbsp;in which a plurality of justices ruled that challenges to partisan gerrymandering are not subject to court oversight since no general standards for judicially challenging partisan gerrymandering exist. Yet the Supreme Court ultimately didn&#8217;t overturn the ruling from the 1986&nbsp;<em>Bandemer&nbsp;</em>case that determined partisan gerrymandering&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;subject to judicial oversight since such&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1580.ZC.html">standards may emerge in the future</a>.</p>



<p>Automated redistricting algorithms basically face the same problem articulated by the Supreme Court ruling in 2004—there continues to be no way to measure at what point a district has been &#8220;gerrymandered,&#8221; and there are no hard rules for what a &#8220;fair district&#8221; is. (Although there are protections against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/09/how-a-widespread-practice-to-politically-empower-african-americans-might-actually-harm-them/">gerrymandering on racial grounds</a>). Merely creating districts randomly or optimized for unbiased parameters (such as compactness or equal-population) is no guarantee that those districts are fair. In absence of simple standards that would make automated redistricting truly feasible, Altman and McDonald suggest another approach to the redistricting problem: using algorithms to foster transparency.</p>



<h2>Bridging the Analog/Digital Divide</h2>



<p>Following the establishment of standing nonpartisan redistricting commissions, Arizona, Washington, and California are now the only three states that are required to solicit public input on redistricting decisions. In these cases, a lightweight machine learning algorithm like the one developed by Jacobson and his colleagues could become an invaluable resource that allows&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/0120_redistricting_report.pdf">voters to make informed decisions</a>&nbsp;about the redistricting plans. Even in states where the redistricting process is entirely in the hands of legislators, algorithmic tools would empower the public to keep their legislators in check by exposing the assumptions that went into the creation of congressional districts.</p>



<p>&#8220;Algorithms are a terrific tool and there could definitely be a role for them,&#8221; Daley said. &#8220;But like independent commissions, they are only as good as the criteria that govern them. The meaningful structural reform that we need involves the way we think about voting and districting itself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Still, the combination of algorithms and independent redistricting commissions may offer a way forward, according to Altman and McDonald. As they argued in an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/how-independent-commissions-could-use-internet-and-open-software-maximize-transparency-and">article</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>Scholars Strategy Network</em>, the internet, coupled with sophisticated and accessible redistricting software, can allow for mass participation in the redistricting process. If this public participation is facilitated by a truly independent commission, which makes all the data, plans and analyses transparent and the tools used to arrive at districts available to the public so that they can compare and comment on these plans, it may be possible to finally create equitable districts.</p>



<p>The plan sounds utopian, but Altman and McDonald have put their principles to work. In 2010, they released an open source software called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.districtbuilder.org/">districtbuilder</a>&nbsp;that enabled broad public participation in the redistricting process by allowing anyone to create, edit, and analyze district plans in a collaborative online environment. While this may sound like it would be reserved for computer nerds with technical know-how, Altman told me it was so simple that they were able to teach elementary school children how to create legal district plans with the tool.</p>



<p>&#8220;Algorithmic redistricting, along with software that enables the public to participate in examining, evaluating and contributing to plans, when implemented thoughtfully and transparently, can be useful as a method of assisting human to argue for and to implement their representational goals,&#8221; Altman said. &#8220;However, most proposed algorithmic solutions, such as maximizing some basic notions of geographic compactness, at best embed a set of arbitrary and poorly understood biases into the system, and at worst are cover for attempts to implement political outcomes by proxy.&#8221;</p>



<p>At the core of the anti-gerrymandering crusade is the notion that a constituency should be represented in accordance with their beliefs, instead of being subjected to the whims of politicians vying to entrench their party&#8217;s power. That our elected representatives are beholden to their constituencies, and not vice versa, is a fundamental tenet of our democracy.</p>



<p>Algorithms are not a silver bullet for our nation&#8217;s gerrymandering problem, but as Altman has labored to show, they can be effectively incorporated into the political apparatus to make the process of redistricting more transparent and fair. But algorithms can only do so much, and their biggest limitation right now is a lack of quantifiable criteria for what constitutes fair districts. Determining these criteria is a totally political issue, and as much as we might wish for an automated solution, no amount of computing power will ever crack that problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Imagine the street you live on is knee-deep in floodwater, and it’s ruining everything in sight, including your home. Now imagine that those awful floodwaters never, ever recede. Instead, the water just keeps rising and rising until your entire country drowns.</h3>
<p>For a number of island nations, that&#8217;s ultimately the significance of the recent reports about <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/10-feet-of-global-sea-level-rise-now-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the unstoppable melt of the massive ice sheets of Antarctica</a> and Greenland, along with hundreds of glaciers.</p>
<p>“We’ve already lost some island atolls. On others the rising sea is destroying homes, washing away coffins and skeletons from graves,” Tony de Brum, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, told me. “Now with every full moon the high tides brings salt water into our streets. We’re moving further inland but can’t move much further.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Marshall Islands are located in the northern Pacific Ocean, and are home to some 70,000 people spread out over 24 low-lying coral atolls. Low-lying, as in six feet above sea level on average. Not only do rising seas flood and erode shorelines, they also make groundwater too salty too drink and “poison” the land with salt so crops and even coconuts trees can’t grow.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/10-feet-of-global-sea-level-rise-now-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motherboard reported</a> that the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet was underway, guaranteeing a minimum of three metres (10 feet) of sea level rise. Another <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/19/doubling-of-antarctic-ice-loss-revealed-by-european-satellite?utm_source=Daily+Carbon+Briefing&amp;utm_campaign=d8e2a29f35-DAILY_BRIEFING&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_876aab4fd7-d8e2a29f35-303421281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> said the melting ice is 31 per cent faster now than between 2005 and 2011. Way up in Greenland, the same thing is happening, according to a new study in the journal Nature Geoscience. And then there was the recent US National Climate Assessment that found Alaska’s and Canada’s glaciers are pumping huge volumes of water into the ocean.</p>
<p>Add it all up and this means many small island nations like the Marshalls—along with countries like the Maldives, Tuvalu, Micronesia, Kiribati, Palau and others—will be swallowed by the sea.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_177" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401200280336425.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-177" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401200280336425.png" alt="Tony de Brum (left) at UN climate COP 19 in Warsaw with US chief negotiator Todd Stern.

<p>“Where are we to go? How are we to survive? What happens to our culture? Will we become wards of another state?” asked de Brum.</p>
<p>“The news from Antarctica should be sobering to anyone from a coastal region around the world,” said Ambassador Marlene Moses of the Republic of Nauru, a small island in the South Pacific home to fewer than 10,000 people.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“We will be moving villages for decades to come. It’s almost beyond comprehension.”</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Moses is also chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), a coalition of 43 low-lying island and coastal nations who are fighting hard to get countries like the US, Canada, China, Japan, and Australia to slash their CO2 emissions and keep future global warming below 1.5 C˚. Anything higher, they believe, and most of these nations will drown.</p>
<p>“I can tell you personally it has been very upsetting to witness what seems like an indifference to the plight of small islands,” Moses said.</p>
<p>When told of the recent science out of Antarctica and Greenland, Claire Anterea, a community worker from the central Pacific island nation of Kiribati responded in despair, “My gosh this is not fair! If the world can’t stop the glacier collapse who will save my people and my country?”</p>
<p>“We have a beautiful life here,” she said, “a simple and subsistence way of living. It is unexplainable to know that our beloved home will disappear.” Kiribati consists of 30-odd pancake flat coral atolls straddling the equator.</p>
<p>The government of Kiribati is hoping to buy thousands of acres on one of Fiji’s islands to relocate its 115,000 residents. While relocation may mean survival, the literal disappearance of their islands risks the overwhelming loss of their culture and identity. When you live on tiny islands in the middle of the enormous Pacific Ocean, land has a very special meaning.</p>
<p>“Without our land how can I explain to my children their roots? Where they come from in the first place?” she said.</p>

<p>Although most of Fiji’s 322 islands won’t vanish under the rising waves—at least not in the next century or so—many of the coastal villages are at risk. One is already being re-located to higher ground. Adapt and retreat is Fiji’s future, and that of its 850,000 people.</p>
<p>“We will be moving villages for decades to come. It’s almost beyond comprehension,” said Alifereti Tawake, a Fijian with the Locally-Managed Marine Area Network.</p>
<p>About 80 percent of all villages are on the coast, he said in an interview from the capital city of Suva. Tawake’s home village of Daku on Kadavu, a small outer island is being flooded during high tides and the people will have to move one day.</p>
<p>People have a very strong attachment to their home village. Everything in the village has important family, cultural and spiritual significance. It is the roots of people’s identity, Tawake said.</p>
<p>Villages that have been proudly self-sufficient for hundreds of years are suddenly helpless and now have to ask for help from outsiders.</p>
<p>“People are saying ‘even if we do everything right, we can’t do anything to stop this,'&#8221; he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;By the time the rest of the world awakes to crisis we&#8217;ve drowned. We are like cockroaches trying to herd elephants.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The small island of Hatohobei and Helen Reef Atoll in Palau is already eroding away. “Soon we will be forced to leave our homes,” said Wayne Andrew from Palau, a country of around 22,000 people, who are spread across 250 islands in the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>“To be very honest, I feel really scared,” said Andrews, who heads a reef protection organization in Palau. Local people wonder what they’ve done wrong and “why they have to pay the ultimate price when other nations are benefiting from all this,” he said, referring to wealthy nations’ high CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>Painful discussions are underway about relocation and moving traditional taro patches and gardens to higher places. There is a lot of work being undertaken to find ways to adapt to the impacts climate change, he said. But ultimately “it is very difficult to know much of our country will vanish.”</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_180" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180" style="width: 1598px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Malé_after_tsunami_cropped.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-180" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Malé_after_tsunami_cropped.jpg" alt="Malé, the capital of the Maldives, after the 2004 tsunami.

<p>Painful is one way to describe the 20 years of United Nations climate negotiations that might have kept the island nations from drowning. This is all about countries agreeing to make major reductions in their CO2 emissions that are heating up the planet. A climate-saving treaty is supposed be finalized at the end of 2015. To say negotiations are not going well is an understatement.</p>
<p>“There is no sense of urgency. It’s frustrating,” said Foreign Minister de Brum, who had just returned home to the Marshall Islands from an informal round of UN climate talks. Countries with the biggest CO2 emissions are more concerned about their economies than the survival of small island nations de Brun said.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the time the rest of the world awakes to crisis we&#8217;ve drowned,” he said. “We are like cockroaches trying to herd elephants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of cockroaches, the three-coral atoll nation of Tokelau became the first country in the world to become 100 percent powered by renewable energy last October. The 1400 Tokelauans are technically living in a territory of New Zealand. In March this year, Tokelau activists along with 15 other Pacific nations held a series of protests against the fossil fuel industry proclaiming: “We are not drowning. We are fighting.”</p>
<p>“Giving up on our home is not an option,” said Tokelau’s Mikaele Maiava, an activist with 350.org.</p>
<p>“We are warriors, and the land we live on is part of us.”</p>

<h3>On the internet nobody knows you’re a dog. Unless you tell them you are. Or that you’re a vampire. Or a werewolf. Or a 90s-era professional wrestler.</h3>



<p>The fake social media profile is an old joke, but lately it’s evolving. Maintaining a fictional online identity has become a lifestyle, a social pursuit, an act of collaborative fiction. The role-playing universe has migrated from the fringes of the internet to that blandest of social networks, Facebook, where it ticks along in parallel to reality. And as role-playing edges closer to the mainstream, it raises questions about just how ‘real’ any of us are in our everyday online lives.</p>



<p>This month has been an interesting one for issues of internet identity. Most recently, Google Plus retired their ban on fake profiles after three years of steady refusal (this would be a landmark in online privacy, were anyone still using Google Plus). Joanie Faircloth, a woman who used Tumblr posts and XOJane comments to accuse musician Conor Oberst of rape, retracted her accusations after months of campaigning against him, admitting she made the story up. And Gilberto Valle, the ‘Cannibal Cop,’ was released after his conviction for plotting to murder and eat several women online was overturned. Consulting messages gleaned from Valle’s profiles on fetish websites, the judge dismissed his plans as nothing more than fantasy role-play.</p>



<blockquote><h3>Facebook has become host to countless role-playing communities, with one for every conceivable fandom.</h3></blockquote>



<p>The question of whether something online is ‘real’ or not remains blurry. Somewhere between the Instagrammed cupcakes that no one actually eats, the dubious viral children and the tiger tamers on Tinder, we smudged the line between fact and fiction. Social media thrives on self-delusion: even Facebook, for all its regime of innocuous Likes, encourages us to present only the positives in life: the sunsets, the restaurant meals, the group-hangs at the beach. The issue is that we all lie online: anyone who’s tried online dating knows that.</p>



<p>Now, we find ourselves at a curious cultural moment: that of fantasy games going mainstream. Facebook has become host to countless role-playing communities, with one for every conceivable fandom.</p>



<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="align-none" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?layer=c&amp;panoid=Qp0yyM3Uc1AAAAQXInc_DA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;source=embed&amp;output=svembed&amp;cbp=13%2C137.44798638050082%2C%2C0%2C21.35357976459683" width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>



<p>The role-playing game dates back to the 1970s, but social media has allowed these collaborative fan fictions to rapidly evolve and cater to tiny niches. What differentiates Facebook games from their predecessors is the players’ readiness to blend their own persona with fiction. Facebook is notoriously strict about fake names, even asking users to rat out friends who use them, and this doesn’t sit well with role-players. Even now there is a split between those who play as themselves and those who chance it using pseudonyms, with fake profiles clustering around controversial RPs like ‘Mental Asylum,’ ‘Slave Market,’ and anything involving wolves (‘wolfplay’ communities appear to be a literal bête noire of the role-playing world, with their lexicon of ‘wolfspeak’ coming in for targeted, often hilarious, criticism).</p>



<p>But by and large, players are content to combine role-play with their personal profiles. The consensus is that most of these players are very young, likely in their early teens. As a generation who learned to write fanfic before they learned to tweet, it makes sense that they view Facebook as a creative outlet. The games they engage in—everything from werewolf conventions to Sherlock-themed mafia wars—serve as an outlet for the bitching, the drama, and the Machiavellian self-advancement which might otherwise turn into cyberbullying.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pawel-kadysz-790-unsplash-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-654" srcset="https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pawel-kadysz-790-unsplash-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pawel-kadysz-790-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pawel-kadysz-790-unsplash-768x576.jpg 768w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pawel-kadysz-790-unsplash-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://kohette.com/wpthemes/narratium/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pawel-kadysz-790-unsplash-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Screenshot of Sherlock Mafia RP Facebook page</figcaption></figure>



<p>They have grown up with a very different concept of ‘me IRL’: any online setting is fair game for self-fashioning. Fantasy role-play, the ultimate anti-selfie, helps to ease players into real life. It serves as training for the day when they role-play as themselves.</p>



<p>The time and care the average player puts into building up their character could put a 90s Tamagotchi owner to shame. Reputations and relationships are slowly forged through one-on-one chats supplementing bigger events on the group page. Finding a partner is crucial, and those who can’t must resort to trawling singles pages.</p>



<p>Role-playing is thought of as one of the more female-friendly parts of the gaming world, one where the male gaze and gender roles can be subverted (one where, for example, Sherlock can be impregnated with Watson’s baby). There is something benign about role-play games: thematically they range from the inane (K-pop groups and shows like Glee and Pretty Little Liars) to the baffling and forlorn (the ‘Roleplay Prom,’ anyone?). They lean towards camp, dwelling on old TV shows, rewriting unsatisfactory endings and keeping long-forgotten fandoms alive.</p>



<p>At times it feels as though role-players hide behind their dense web of abbreviations for protection from a skeptical public. There’s a lack of coherence across role-play communities, with no two identical explanations of how the games actually work. To make up for its conflicts, this unruly world polices itself: each page specifies an age limit and their own grammatical etiquette.</p>



<p>To join the social network but then act out of character confounds the patterns Facebook aims to record.<br>Formatting and spelling are valued, as are the word counts which ‘literate’ role-playing communities enforce (“Your starters and replies MUST be at least five sentences long” states the group “Literate Roleplay!☆彡”). Posts are gently overwritten in that very internet way: players include accents, vocal tics, even animal noises. The fourth wall is occasionally broken with messages enclosed in brackets, politely asking for permission to take part.</p>



<p>Role-players disapprove of ‘god modding,’ when a player writes an invincible character who is boringly immune to attacks. Another common complaint is failure to finish games: players drop off, life gets in the way, and communities diminish. As with blogs where the author apologizes for being ‘so busy’ only to disappear several posts later, Facebook is littered with communities which have streamed off into nothingness, sounding boards full of unheard ‘prompts’ and bitter announcements that the page owner is thinking of giving up.</p>



<p>Roleplay Gateway, a site which claims to be 50,000 strong, features a chart of its most popular role-plays. Those which thrive consistently are not always predictable: Harry Potter plots do well, as do Skyrim and Hunger Games role-plays, and various factions of vampires and werewolves from Twilight. One of the more surprising themes is WWE wrestling, a hyperbolic world unto itself which is detailed in this Reddit post (expect multiple marriages to WWE Divas, family feuds, and a prison term for a man named ‘Nitro’).</p>



<p>For all its eccentricity, role-playing appears to come naturally to those who do it. And yet it goes against everything Facebook wants of us—a service that even manages to harvest shadow profiles on people that haven’t signed up. To join the social network but then act out of character confounds the patterns Facebook aims to record. In a small way it disrupts the slow, pernicious blandness that social media encourages, letting our alter egos spill out messily around the edges.</p>



<p>It gives rise to a new age of consensual catfishing, one in which we are finally at ease with the fact that our online presence has always been a little bit fake.</p>
