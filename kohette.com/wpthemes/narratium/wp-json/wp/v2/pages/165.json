When the user navigate this page after activating the theme for the first time, WordPress triggers a series of actions that help the theme starts the initial configuration in case it did not happen correctly at the moment in which the theme is activated .<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Set Logo and Favicon<\/h4>\n<p>Both the logo and the favicon of your site can be configured in the administration page Appearance -&gt; Customize -&gt; Site Identity. Within this section you can upload an image for the logo and another for the favicon. In Narratium it is advisable to use a square image for the logo. This logo will be displayed in the theme sidebar, above the site title and description. In the &#8220;Logo size&#8221; option you can configure the size in which you want the logo to appear.<\/p>\n<p>Narratium displays the site favicon in the upper left corner as a button to display the site&#8217;s main menu. It is therefore advisable to use an image of at least 100&#215;100 pixels.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Installation To install Narratium on your WordPress site you just have to get in the WordPress administration and follow the next steps.
