The fine-structure constant, by contrast, has no dimensions or units. It\u2019s a pure number that shapes the universe to an astonishing degree \u2014 \u201ca magic number that comes to us with no understanding,\u201d as Richard Feynman described it. Paul Dirac considered the origin of the number \u201cthe most fundamental unsolved problem of physics.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Numerically, the fine-structure constant, denoted by the Greek letter \u03b1 (alpha), comes very close to the ratio 1\/137. It commonly appears in formulas governing light and matter. \u201cIt\u2019s like in architecture, there\u2019s the golden ratio,\u201d said&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.colorado.edu\/physics\/eric-cornell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eric Cornell<\/a>, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. \u201cIn the physics of low-energy matter \u2014 atoms, molecules, chemistry, biology \u2014 there\u2019s always a ratio\u201d of bigger things to smaller things, he said. \u201cThose ratios tend to be powers of the fine-structure constant.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The constant is everywhere because it characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic force affecting charged particles such as electrons and protons. \u201cIn our everyday world, everything is either gravity or electromagnetism. And that\u2019s why alpha is so important,\u201d said&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/physics.berkeley.edu\/people\/faculty\/holger-muller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Holger M\u00fcller<\/a>, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. Because 1\/137 is small, electromagnetism is weak; as a consequence, charged particles form airy atoms whose electrons orbit at a distance and easily hop away, enabling chemical bonds. On the other hand, the constant is also just big enough: Physicists have argued that if it were something like 1\/138, stars would not be able to create carbon, and life as we know it wouldn\u2019t exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-dots\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"line-height-1dot5\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Physicists have more or less given up on a century-old obsession over where alpha\u2019s particular value comes from; they now acknowledge that the fundamental constants could be random, decided in cosmic dice rolls during the universe\u2019s birth.

The recoil velocity reveals how heavy rubidium atoms are \u2014 the hardest factor to gauge in a simple formula for the fine-structure constant. \u201cIt\u2019s always the least accurate measurement that\u2019s the bottleneck, so any improvement in that leads to an improvement in the fine-structure constant,\u201d M\u00fcller explained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full full-width wild-element is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/greg-rakozy-53292-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-643\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/greg-rakozy-53292-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/greg-rakozy-53292-300x155.jpg 300w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/greg-rakozy-53292-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/greg-rakozy-53292-768x398.jpg 768w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/greg-rakozy-53292-1536x795.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/greg-rakozy-53292-2048x1060.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><figcaption>Look this <strong><em>nice<\/em><\/strong> <strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\">Image Caption<\/span><\/strong>!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Paris experimenters begin by cooling the rubidium atoms almost to absolute zero, then dropping them in a vacuum chamber. As the cloud of atoms falls, the researchers use laser pulses to put the atoms in a quantum superposition of two states \u2014 kicked by a photon and not kicked. The two possible versions of each atom travel on separate trajectories until more laser pulses bring the halves of the superposition back together. The more an atom recoils when kicked by light, the more out of phase it is with the unkicked version of itself. The researchers measure this difference to reveal the atoms\u2019 recoil velocity. \u201cFrom the recoil velocity, we extract the mass of the atom, and the mass of the atom is directly involved in the determination of the fine-structure constant,\u201d Guellati-Kh\u00e9lifa said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code site-palette-yin-1-background-color site-palette-yang-2-color\"><code>.min-height-10vh            {min-height:10vh}\n.min-height-20vh            {min-height:20vh}\n.min-height-30vh            {min-height:30vh}\n.min-height-40vh            {min-height:40vh}\n.min-height-50vh            {min-height:50vh}\n.min-height-60vh            {min-height:60vh}\n.min-height-70vh            {min-height:70vh}\n.min-height-80vh            {min-height:80vh}\n.min-height-90vh            {min-height:90vh}\n.min-height-100vh           {min-height:100vh}\n\n.min-height-10vw            {min-height:10vw}\n.min-height-20vw            {min-height:20vw}\n.min-height-30vw            {min-height:30vw}\n.min-height-40vw            {min-height:40vw}\n.min-height-50vw            {min-height:50vw}\n.min-height-60vw            {min-height:60vw}\n.min-height-70vw            {min-height:70vw}\n.min-height-80vw            {min-height:80vw}\n.min-height-90vw            {min-height:90vw}\n.min-height-100vw           {min-height:100vw}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In such precise experiments, every detail matters.
