These futuristic landscapes suggest we&#8217;re about to see a bevy of unfathomably large infrastructure investments that will reshape our cities in the next couple decades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now take a look outside at your nearest bombed-out road or crumbling bridge. Yeah, your metropolis isn&#8217;t going to be turning into Emerald City any time soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s actually going to happen is already happening now: The future will appear, not in leaps and bounds, but on a moving sidewalk, gliding onward just smoothly enough that it doesn&#8217;t shake you into recognition. It&#8217;s still going to take decades for California to complete its futuristic high-speed rail line, for example; when it arrives, it&#8217;s still going to look like a train.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about environmental aesthetics for the past few days, which corresponds with how long I&#8217;ve had Fernando Barbella&#8217;s <a title=\"Signs from the near future Tumblr\" href=\"http:\/\/signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Signs from the Near Future<\/a> open on a browser tab. The Barcelona-based creative director started a Tumblr to investigate how the new technologies we dream of will actually begin to subvert our surroundings\u2014which, in our litigious world, mainly means a planet filled with futuristic warning signs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/taylor-nicole-37744-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-644\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/taylor-nicole-37744-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/taylor-nicole-37744-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/taylor-nicole-37744-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/taylor-nicole-37744-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/taylor-nicole-37744-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>&#8220;All selfies taken with your smart contact lenses will be shared in real time with the proper authorities&#8221;.

But of course that&#8217;s not true. Pithy sentiments like &#8220;every new day is the future&#8221; or whatever, the future is ever-arriving and always evolving. No one is going to flip a switch and suddenly fill our streets with hovercars. (That&#8217;d be rad though!) But one day you&#8217;re going to see an autonomous taxi for the first time and say, &#8220;No shit, those are here now? Cool.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was going for that point: many years ago, when we were kids, the visions for the future were at least disconnected from reality: flying cars, strange architecture buildings surrounding us, among other out of its time things,&#8221; Barbella said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/christoffer-engstrom-26542-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-641\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/christoffer-engstrom-26542-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/christoffer-engstrom-26542-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/christoffer-engstrom-26542-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/christoffer-engstrom-26542-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/christoffer-engstrom-26542-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>&#8220;15% off on synthetic burguers!&#8221;. Image: <a href=\"http:\/\/signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com\/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Signs From The Near Future<\/a>.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The real thing is that [the] future is always part of the present times, in a way, and that&#8217;s why I focused on this approach to a near future where we see these technologies coexisting with us in the most ordinary of environments and places,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our difficulty in seeing progress as discrete events makes it harder for us to institute checks and balances along the way. It&#8217;s not such an issue for a consumer-facing product like Google Glass; Glass appeared, we all marveled\u2014or scoffed\u2014and now we&#8217;re figuring out new social norms as we go along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But considering future manifestations of power, such perpetual change is harder to grasp. Take full-body scanners at the airport, or location-based <a href=\"http:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/en_ca\/blog\/maybe-the-most-orwellian-text-message-ever-sent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">government text messages aimed at protestors<\/a>. Both are very futuristic, concerning things in the abstract, but when actually faced with either, the common response is something more like, &#8220;Wait, they can do this now?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we don&#8217;t accept the future as an endless slog forward, it becomes a lot harder to draw a line in the sand\u2014largely because we&#8217;re still waiting for that line to arrive. And as we wait for that line\u2014and for the courts to rule on cases regarding technology that&#8217;s already out of date\u2014the framework for the future is constantly being laid around us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/kristof-vizy-98603-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-647\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/kristof-vizy-98603-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/kristof-vizy-98603-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/kristof-vizy-98603-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/kristof-vizy-98603-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/kohette.com\/wpthemes\/narratium\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/kristof-vizy-98603-2048x1371.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Image: <a href=\"http:\/\/signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com\/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Signs From The Near Future<\/a>.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will probably never know how worried the people at the top are about the democratization of new technologies, and all the doors and windows and new paths these things are opening for regular Joes like us,&#8221; Barbella said. &#8220;So we can clearly imagine this near future full of warnings and signs telling us how\u2014or when\u2014to use or not to use these technologies originally designed to improve our lives.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barbella said that as the project continues, he hopes to cross it over into the physical world, either with a book or a show, or perhaps by producing signs for real and &#8220;start doing some urban interventions.&#8221; He also said that, despite his project standing as a reminder that we need to wake up with regards to our progress, he maintains a positive outlook on the world to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The whole responsibility is on us. Not the governments, not the monstrous corporations.
